,TalesFromRetail,"I was just reminded of this while reading another post and thought I would share. A long time ago I managed a local mulch store, we sold mulch and other landscape supply items. My employees were mostly high school kids working part time. We had a policy that broken bags were sold at a discount since the bag was no longer full.

One afternoon someone called the store and asked if we had any broken bags of one type of mulch and he was told we did, he said he would be in soon to get them, but he didn't leave a name. 

A little while later one of my guys came into the office looking really upset and said a customer was out in the yard cussing at them because they had sold the broken bags to someone else a little bit ago.

I marched out there and they had loaded some bags into his car and I stopped them from loading more. I looked at the guy and asked him why he was cussing at my people. He started by saying he had called about the broken bags and they had sold them. I stopped him and said why does that give you the right to yell and cuss at high school kids. He looked very sheepish and I started to unload his car and if you don't want these I will put them back and I will refund him his money and he can get out.

It was kind of funny he said ""I need them"" in a quiet voice. I said OK then, try to act like a grown up (I wasn't that old myself I think he was in his 40's) We loaded him up and sent him on his way.

The sad part was if he had given us his name we would have held them, or if he had come into the office and explained what had happened I would have given him a discount.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work in car sales. My least favorite part about it is test driving with customers, and this is the tale of why I am absolutely right to fear for my life every single time.

&amp;#x200B;

Our story starts on a sunny afternoon one pandemic ago with a couple coming in to look at cars for the guy's grandma. They choose one they like and want to buy, and we schedule a test drive for the next day. Just as they are leaving, the guy tells me this is supposed to be a test - grandma isn't comfortable driving her van anymore, so she will either get something smaller or give up driving altogether. Honestly my story should end right here but I kept thinking it can't possibly be that bad. &gt;!It would actually be even worse.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

The next day rolls around and grandma and son show up together - insultingly late of course - and we get the paperwork sorted. Since they are two people, we have to drive twice. The son goes first. His driving is awful, but at least he keeps the car intact. Do not be fooled though, I still feared for my life because he kept looking at things *with his face* \- this is a secret most car manufacturers don't want you to know, but you can actually observe buttons with only your eyes. Touching them with your nose is not required in most newer models.

We get back to the dealership, he parks, and upon leaving the car he tells me they'll go and check on his son. Whom they left in their car. Unattended. The whole time, in the middle of summer, at the ripe old age of 2. So I awkwardly wait around for them to return from accepting the Parent of the Year Award, not yet knowing what kind of treat I'm in for next.

&amp;#x200B;

It is grandma's turn to drive now. Can she drive a manual? Yes. Does she need help? No. Does she have any questions before we start?

""Yes, what is the clutch and how do I use it?""

I want to scream. I look around helplessly, staring into our CCTV cameras as if they were some kind of vehicular deity looking down upon me with their cold black eyes, pleading for mercy, for someone to end my suffering. My prayers go unheard. I have to fight this battle alone. So I carefully extract the remaining bits of patience out of my cells and find myself in the role of an aging driving instructor, hardened with the years, my wife left me long ago, it is a thankless job. And when she finally thinks she is ready, grandma releases the clutch for the first time, making the engine scream in pain as we inch away from our parking spot. Off we go, hitting the curb on our way out, but we are moving.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a designated, tried and tested, test driving route. Grandma needs directions every 3.78 seconds. ""What do I do?"" - ""You go straight."" - ""And now?"" - ""You keep following the road."" - ""And now?"" - ""You keep going straight and then turn right at the intersection."" - ""Now?"" - ""No, at the intersection."" - ""Now?"" - ""No, at the intersection that is coming up."" - ""Now?"" - ""No."" - ""Now?"" - ""Yes, turn right now.""

I slowly start to lose my mind and question every single one of my life choices. Maybe I could be sitting in the wilderness somewhere right now, getting mauled by a bear. It certainly would be less painful.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon our odyssey leads us into a curve under a bridge, a very dangerous spot to stop in, because you can't look around the corner so if someone was to stop in said corner, you would run into them. Grandma stops in the corner.

In the middle of the road. It is just us, the poor car, and an unforgivingly sunny day. I ask her to please move out of the way of destruction at least. She says she can't, she needs to test the gears now. So we sit in our corner, putting in every single gear once, because grandma ""can't tell which gear it's in"" and has to keep looking down instead of focusing on the road. Is it rude to suggest an automatic?

Just a few meters later, grandma pulls over again and lets her son drive, because ""there is a big intersection coming up"" and she can't do it. Is it rude to suggest giving up driving now?

&amp;#x200B;

My least favorite part about it is test driving with customers, and this is the tale of why I am absolutely right to fear for my life every single time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story starts on a sunny afternoon one pandemic ago with a couple coming in to look at cars for the guy&amp;#39;s grandma. They choose one they like and want to buy, and we schedule a test drive for the next day. Just as they are leaving, the guy tells me this is supposed to be a test - grandma isn&amp;#39;t comfortable driving her van anymore, so she will either get something smaller or give up driving altogether. Honestly my story should end right here but I kept thinking it can&amp;#39;t possibly be that bad. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;It would actually be even worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day rolls around and grandma and son show up together - insultingly late of course - and we get the paperwork sorted. Since they are two people, we have to drive twice. The son goes first. His driving is awful, but at least he keeps the car intact. Do not be fooled though, I still feared for my life because he kept looking at things &lt;em&gt;with his face&lt;/em&gt; - this is a secret most car manufacturers don&amp;#39;t want you to know, but you can actually observe buttons with only your eyes. Touching them with your nose is not required in most newer models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get back to the dealership, he parks, and upon leaving the car he tells me they&amp;#39;ll go and check on his son. Whom they left in their car. Unattended. The whole time, in the middle of summer, at the ripe old age of 2. So I awkwardly wait around for them to return from accepting the Parent of the Year Award, not yet knowing what kind of treat I&amp;#39;m in for next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is grandma&amp;#39;s turn to drive now. Can she drive a manual? Yes. Does she need help? No. Does she have any questions before we start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, what is the clutch and how do I use it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to scream. I look around helplessly, staring into our CCTV cameras as if they were some kind of vehicular deity looking down upon me with their cold black eyes, pleading for mercy, for someone to end my suffering. My prayers go unheard. I have to fight this battle alone. So I carefully extract the remaining bits of patience out of my cells and find myself in the role of an aging driving instructor, hardened with the years, my wife left me long ago, it is a thankless job. And when she finally thinks she is ready, grandma releases the clutch for the first time, making the engine scream in pain as we inch away from our parking spot. Off we go, hitting the curb on our way out, but we are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a designated, tried and tested, test driving route. Grandma needs directions every 3.78 seconds. &amp;quot;What do I do?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;You go straight.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;And now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;You keep following the road.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;And now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;You keep going straight and then turn right at the intersection.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;No, at the intersection.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;No, at the intersection that is coming up.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Now?&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Yes, turn right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slowly start to lose my mind and question every single one of my life choices. Maybe I could be sitting in the wilderness somewhere right now, getting mauled by a bear. It certainly would be less painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon our odyssey leads us into a curve under a bridge, a very dangerous spot to stop in, because you can&amp;#39;t look around the corner so if someone was to stop in said corner, you would run into them. Grandma stops in the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the road. It is just us, the poor car, and an unforgivingly sunny day. I ask her to please move out of the way of destruction at least. She says she can&amp;#39;t, she needs to test the gears now. So we sit in our corner, putting in every single gear once, because grandma &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t tell which gear it&amp;#39;s in&amp;quot; and has to keep looking down instead of focusing on the road. Is it rude to suggest an automatic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few meters later, grandma pulls over again and lets her son drive, because &amp;quot;there is a big intersection coming up&amp;quot; and she can&amp;#39;t do it. Is it rude to suggest giving up driving now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally make it back to the dealership. 15 minutes can change a person, I know that now. One last &amp;quot;we brought the car back without huge losses&amp;quot; signature, and we&amp;#39;re done. Silence. Expectations.

,TalesFromRetail,"Today I've been reminded about one of my best moments in retail.

I've been working at an electronics store. Sometimes in the department that offered hygiene products.We sold electric toothbrushes as well as razors, hair clipper and everything like that.One of every new item had to be unboxed and put on display (secured with a cable connected to an alarm system that would be triggered if the item/cable was removed) so that people could touch and look at them.

Every single device that came included with an integrated rechargeable battery came preloaded.Cause of that we found lipstickmarkers on toothbrushes or hairs and dander in razors because people TESTED them for real (disgusting, but it seemed like they didn't mind who allready tested them before)

So one day we decided to unload them before we put them on display  (brrrrrrrrmmmm for hours in our departments drawers while their batteries were running low)

Everything worked fine until... new girl forgot to do this with a facial epilator. We decided to not unplug and unload it. To much effort for this single device. What should go wrong?So on this one nice  sunny day where nothing else happened except birds singing and flowers blooming  I've been minding my own business until I heard something like ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  AAAAAAAHHHHHHH"" just behind  me.And there he was. Guy in his 30s. Big, fat, fabulous, gorgeous beard.His hand holding something that seemed to be attached to this glorious beard. That's attached to the cable that leads to our alarmsystem.Oh noes. No. You are kidding me. You just can't be serious.Really? OMG. HAHA. NO WAY!As I walked over to him (allready giggling) I tried to be serious while asking: may I help you?Him: ""My beard got stuck""Me: ""in?""Him: ""in this facial epilator""Me: \*couldn't hold it back anymore, laughing\* ""one moment please, I'll search for a scissor""Him: ""OMG you can't do this. My beard! Look at my beard!. There would be a hole. There has to be an other way!""

After a lot of arguing he finally agreed to buy this epilator and take it home so he or his wife could find a better way to get rid of it.

I was helping some ladies out and one of them pulls a small white square out of her wallet. 

Her: Can you tell me what kind of battery this is? It’s from the remote for my fireplace.

Me: Uhh.... I’m pretty sure that’s not a battery.

Her: But it was inside the remote. My remote stopped working and when I opened it up to change see the battery, I found this. 

Me: Was there anything else in the remote or just that?

Her: This was the only thing inside.

Me: Okay... would it be alright if I took a picture and looked up the information printed on it?

They agreed so I snapped a photo and walked over to the nearest computer to look it up. When I found out what it was I went back. 

Me: So... ma’am. It’s kind of funny. What you have there isn’t a battery. It’s a bag clip. The information printed on the clip is for a company that grows potatoes.

Her friend gave the heartiest laugh and she started laughing out of shock. 

Her: I’ve never opened the remote before!! Why would it be in there?!?

I couldn’t answer that question but they were really good-natured about it. I ended up looking up the retailer she bought her fireplace from and finding a PDF for her model.

At first my co-worker V was dealing with this customer who wanted to do a return but was unable to do it on the registers in the department since it was a late return but unused. Product being returned passed the 30 day mark can be accepted as long as it was still in its original box and never used at all. 

I continued working and eventually went to the back office where V was trying to the return. As I was walking to the back, I see the customer with a power washer in a box but it looked like a very older model. I go in the office and V asks me to look at the receipt.

V: ""Hey take a look at this real quick.""

Me: ""What about it?""

V: ""Look at the date. I was surprised when I saw it myself.""

I looked at the date. **APRIL 28, 1998!!!!!!** The power washer was as old as I was when they bought it! (I'm a 23M as I'm typing this out and was 19 at the time) I looked at him confused and he told me that the guy never used it at all since he's bought it. He just left it in his shed and has been sitting there for 19 years! How do you forget spending $230 and not put it to use? We went to the customer, who is pretty chill and understands that we would be having trouble explained how its been sitting unopened in his shed since he forgot. 

Customer: ""Sorry for the trouble but apparently I never needed it.""

V: ""It's alright. The system needs a manager to approve it since its so old.""

Me slightly chuckling: ""How did you forget? This thing is old as me.""

Customer also chuckles: ""I bought it to have it for when I had to clean my house or car or driveway but never needed it so it stayed in its box and just sat in the shed till today when I was cleaning it out. Still got the original receipt that you holding so I thought I try to return it.""

The three of us we just poking fun about it and V said he'd get the manager to figure something out. A few minutes went by and the manager arrived to merchandise pickup where the customer was with the power washer. He looks at the receipt and at the box. Seeing it in practically perfect condition says he'll do the return but can't do a full one. The customer was fine with it and went with the manager to do the return.

Long ago people had to actually travel to bookstores to feed the fiction addiction. I worked in such a store located in a mall. One of the most notable features of this store was a set of low shelves as you entered that held both the week's hardcover new releases and sale titles. I was working the till one day when a woman came up with 7 or 8 hardcovers. This wasn't uncommon and I would ring several $100+ purchases per day. After I rang them out, I provided the total and she balked at the amount.

""No, that's not right. It's too much.""

We went through the order and found she had 3 new releases she claimed were on sale. We never discounted a book in it's first week of release, but a sign error wasn't impossible. I asked her to show me where the books came from and she took me to the front of the store to the new releases and sales shelf.

She pointed to a large red sign attached to the shelf and went ""See, save up to 50% off."" Indeed the sign did say that, but the line underneath read 'stickered titles only, see sticker for discount'

""Ma'am the sign states that only stickered titles are discounted and you can see that some of the books have red stickers showing their discount percentage. As these titles aren't tagged they are not on sale and are full price.""

""Well how was I supposed to know they weren't on sale?""

,TalesFromRetail,"Thought you all might enjoy a feel good experience I had last week at work.

I work in a mall at a store that you can easily recognize for the music, the clothing, and collectables. I enjoy working there for the most part and my managers really like how I am able to connect with customers about what we sell, particularly with the anime we sell. Whenever I see someone in the anime section, I go up to see if they are looking for something, help them find it, and then chat with them about the series (doing this has helped me up-sell many-a-times).

Anyway, last Friday, an older woman came in the store and went to our anime section. I was a bit surprised but I figured she was shopping for someone else and could use help figuring out which anime is which (something that happens a lot with parents, guardians, and such). I go up and ask her if she was looking for anything, to which she told me she was looking for Attach on Titan shirts. As luck would have it, we actually had just gotten a restock of one style and a new shirt for the final season. When I showed her, I saw her eyes light up and I could tell she had a smile under her mask. She happily took both and explained that she watches the anime with her grandchildren. I expressed a bit of surprise and said that was pretty cool. She then added that her grandkid, who she looked after during the day earlier during the pandemic would watch the series. Apparently the entire anime sparked her interest, so she went back to the very start and watched all of Attack on Titan from the beginning to catch up so she could enjoy it with them.

I told her that's so awesome that she did that so they could both enjoy the anime together. With a laugh, she added that it wasn't exactly her first anime as she also enjoyed watching watching a number of classic anime like Speed Racer and Gigantor (the latter of which she seemed surprised I knew well, and we sung the theme song).

From there, I informed her that if she needed anything else, just let us know and I went to help another customer looking at another part of the anime section. It was a mother looking at the My Hero Academia section for something for their kid. I asked them if they knew a favorite character or could describe them (something that has helped). With the information they gave, I figured out that Kirishima was their favorite and helped them. The grandmother from before saw this and made a comment to the mother I was assisting about how knowledgeable and helpful I was, to which she agreed.

,TalesFromRetail,"Hello fellow lurkers. So this happened today and everything is still fresh on my mind. It's a long one so a TL:DR is at the end.

I'm a bit dyslexic and writing long paragraphs is a bit of a struggle for me, so bear with me.. haha

I work in a retailer that is in most of Europe. We have no guards or security so it's our job to keep track of shoplifters.This day I had a late start, so after cleaning the shop floor of loose cardboard I started working the stock of meat. While working it I noticed a guy taking off his backpack and talking to his sister. His sister came in with an old-lady buggy(very popular here) and putting her shopping in there. Mostly bagged veggies and fruit. I finished the putting out the meat, put all the empty meat trays on a pallet and started to head back to the warehouse. Just as I started to turn the corner I saw the guy had picked up a piece of pork fillet and was walking to his sister, backpack still in his hand too. He was also sort of watching me to. Instantly I took note of this as I've seen this trick dozen's of times.

I left the pallet with empty trays and made a quick lap around the aisle, I wanted to see if the meat had ""disappeared"". After turning the corner I saw the couple, the backpack was again on the guys back and her buggy did not have the meat in it. Great! I thought... I called out on the radio to all the staff that there might be a potential shoplifting couple and gave a brief description of how they look. I followed them around to see if they would try to take anything else, but they didn't, they just walked to  the tills to start unloading what they were going to buy.

I called out to the cashier and asked to see if they unloaded the pork fillet on the belt. I got a quick reply saying that there wasn't one there. So I quickly positioned myself at the exit and was waiting for them. They almost instantly clocked me and the dude was staring at me, they gave each other a quick glance, said something and the guy quickly started walking back to the shop floor. I quickly walked to the aisle to see what he's doing. The guy took of his bag, unzipped it and threw the meat to the back of the shelf and started looping around the store.

While this was happening the girls shopping was already scanned and she was paying. I turned to her and told her bluntly, after paying you and your friend are not welcomed back here again. Her eyes popped out, she threw the coins that she was counting and started yelling. I did nothing wrong! I calmly explained that her friend tried to shoplift. While this was happening the guy came back and heard of my accusations and was outraged. He started yelling and threatening me. After seeing my name badge, he said"" oh \*blank\* you should watch your back, you will get hurt. They both were hurling insults at me and my manager. At the end the girl paid for her shopping, I checked the bag even tho I knew he's not that dumb to leave anything in there and they left, while hurling insults and saying they will call the cops.

A couple hours pass and I'm on till covering my colleagues break. All staff including managers are on till as there is a big rush going on. I hear on the radio from the person on break that there is an situation in the canteen and a manager needs to come. So my manager closes his till and goes there, a minute passes and I'm being called in also.

So I close my till and go to the canteen. What do I see... Another one of my colleagues, the woman from earlier and my manager. Turns out the shoplifting couple were son and daughter of one of my colleagues. Straight away... I can see that this is gonna be good!

From this moment ill need to put in some characters:

Me is me

A is The woman from earlier

B is The mom(my colleague)

M is Manager

I sit down and instantly ""A"" starts yelling at me:

A- I did not shoplift! Even if my brother did, you had no right to come up to me! And if you didn't knew I'm pregnant! (Even tho she did not look pregnant at all, even with a low cut shirt)B- Stop yelling, let OP explain what happened

Me- As I said at the tills, you are an accomplice to the deed and while you... (I got cut off)

A- How dare you call me an accomplice! He put the meat back!

Me- After you both saw me standing at the exit looking at you.

B- So you admit it that they were not shoplifting so you have no right to ban my son&amp;daughter

M- This is a deterred attempt to shoplift at any point, both of you and your brother were not just yelling and causing a scene, but also threatened my colleague with harm.

B- Yes for this we are sorry, there was no reason for those threats. (Even tho the daughter never said sorry for any of this)

A- But he!(Points at me) Had no right to come up to me and accuse me of any of this! And I want an apology

Me- Haha( I genuinely laughed) No, that is not happening. You both know what you were trying to do. Not to mention( Got cut off again)

A- Ohhh?! A big man aren't you?

At this point the mom started playing devils advocate and saying that they were not shoplifting if they were not walking out with the stolen bits and was almost demanding that I'd apologize. Again I started to explain what I saw and again was cut off by A

Me- So I see we are going in circles, my suggestion is to watch the security footage as a picture will say a thousand words more than me. I asked the manager if I can go back to work

M- Yeah, I think we are done here, I will let the store manager know what happened, what we talked about and he will be the determining factor if you guys are banned or not.

So I left the canteen and all the staff were already waiting for me to tell the story of what happened in there, which of course... I did.. It was far too funny...

So that's about it. Thank you for reading!

TL:DR brother and sister were shoplifting, I deterred them, they threw a fuss about it when I banned them, their mom(which is also my colleague) came back with her daughter for an apology, which was not provided by me.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE 1:

So today I talked with the store manager for around 10 minutes, discussing what's going to happen next, as the mom(colleague) has not approached him about this. 

So the ""Kids"" which are 25 and 28 are not banned at the moment and can come to shop, but me and anyone are allowed to check their bags for any reason and if they kick off, they will be ""citizen arrested"" and the cops will be called.

After everyone's suggestion to report the threats to the police, I have called the non emergency police line and spoken to one of the officers and filed a report, as I gave them the guys name, which was easy to get, as the mom mentioned it several times. The officer did tell me that the guy is known for criminal behavior, so this won't be just filed and left on the side.

That's about it for now... If there are any further updates ill post the here.

So this happened today and everything is still fresh on my mind. It&amp;#39;s a long one so a TL:DR is at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit dyslexic and writing long paragraphs is a bit of a struggle for me, so bear with me.. haha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a retailer that is in most of Europe. We have no guards or security so it&amp;#39;s our job to keep track of shoplifters.This day I had a late start, so after cleaning the shop floor of loose cardboard I started working the stock of meat. While working it I noticed a guy taking off his backpack and talking to his sister. His sister came in with an old-lady buggy(very popular here) and putting her shopping in there. Mostly bagged veggies and fruit. I finished the putting out the meat, put all the empty meat trays on a pallet and started to head back to the warehouse. Just as I started to turn the corner I saw the guy had picked up a piece of pork fillet and was walking to his sister, backpack still in his hand too. He was also sort of watching me to. Instantly I took note of this as I&amp;#39;ve seen this trick dozen&amp;#39;s of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the pallet with empty trays and made a quick lap around the aisle, I wanted to see if the meat had &amp;quot;disappeared&amp;quot;. After turning the corner I saw the couple, the backpack was again on the guys back and her buggy did not have the meat in it. Great! I thought... I called out on the radio to all the staff that there might be a potential shoplifting couple and gave a brief description of how they look. I followed them around to see if they would try to take anything else, but they didn&amp;#39;t, they just walked to  the tills to start unloading what they were going to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called out to the cashier and asked to see if they unloaded the pork fillet on the belt. I got a quick reply saying that there wasn&amp;#39;t one there. So I quickly positioned myself at the exit and was waiting for them. They almost instantly clocked me and the dude was staring at me, they gave each other a quick glance, said something and the guy quickly started walking back to the shop floor. I quickly walked to the aisle to see what he&amp;#39;s doing. The guy took of his bag, unzipped it and threw the meat to the back of the shelf and started looping around the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was happening the girls shopping was already scanned and she was paying. I turned to her and told her bluntly, after paying you and your friend are not welcomed back here again. Her eyes popped out, she threw the coins that she was counting and started yelling. I did nothing wrong! I calmly explained that her friend tried to shoplift. While this was happening the guy came back and heard of my accusations and was outraged. He started yelling and threatening me. After seeing my name badge, he said&amp;quot; oh *blank* you should watch your back, you will get hurt. They both were hurling insults at me and my manager. At the end the girl paid for her shopping, I checked the bag even tho I knew he&amp;#39;s not that dumb to leave anything in there and they left, while hurling insults and saying they will call the cops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple hours pass and I&amp;#39;m on till covering my colleagues break. All staff including managers are on till as there is a big rush going on. I hear on the radio from the person on break that there is an situation in the canteen and a manager needs to come. So my manager closes his till and goes there, a minute passes and I&amp;#39;m being called in also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I close my till and go to the canteen. What do I see... Another one of my colleagues, the woman from earlier and my manager. Turns out the shoplifting couple were son and daughter of one of my colleagues. Straight away... I can see that this is gonna be good!&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I used to work in a little thrift store, basically half of a converted house (the other half housed the offices for the charity the store benefited).  Mostly we had very low prices, especially for clothing: we were lower than any of the other thrift stores in town. This was simply because we got so much clothing donated and had so little space to put it that it was more profitable to sell inexpensively as quickly as possible And we set one price for each type of clothing, for example all T-shirts were a dollar, so we didn’t have to spend money or time tagging them.  

Which brings us to the lady with the two dollar skirt. I was putting out clothes on the racks, aiming for our usual level of minimally disorganized, when this lady held up a long skirt to show me.  I said something about it being very nice and she said, “well I was just thinking about getting it because I have a pillow I want to recover and if I went to a fabric store, this much fabric of this quality would probably cost me $18.”

I said something about that being quite clever and how lucky it was she found a skirt that she liked that had enough fabric. But I didn’t think much of it and continued putting out the rest the clothes I had. 

About 10 minutes later when I’m going to the back to get some more clothes to put out, the lady who was sitting at the front desk taking money asked me if I would watch the desk for a couple minutes while she went to the bathroom.  So I happen to be sitting there with the lady with the skirt walks up and sets it down. As I’m taking the hanger off, She says, “so I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the price? Because I’m just going to use the fabric and it seems like a lot to just use some of the fabric.“

At first I thought she was joking, then I realized she really didn’t recognize me as the person she had just spoken to and was quite serious. I just laughed and said, “really? You just told me that this was at least $18 worth of fabric and what a great buy it was.”

Mostly we had very low prices, especially for clothing: we were lower than any of the other thrift stores in town. This was simply because we got so much clothing donated and had so little space to put it that it was more profitable to sell inexpensively as quickly as possible And we set one price for each type of clothing, for example all T-shirts were a dollar, so we didn’t have to spend money or time tagging them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the lady with the two dollar skirt. I was putting out clothes on the racks, aiming for our usual level of minimally disorganized, when this lady held up a long skirt to show me.  I said something about it being very nice and she said, “well I was just thinking about getting it because I have a pillow I want to recover and if I went to a fabric store, this much fabric of this quality would probably cost me $18.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said something about that being quite clever and how lucky it was she found a skirt that she liked that had enough fabric. But I didn’t think much of it and continued putting out the rest the clothes I had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 minutes later when I’m going to the back to get some more clothes to put out, the lady who was sitting at the front desk taking money asked me if I would watch the desk for a couple minutes while she went to the bathroom.  So I happen to be sitting there with the lady with the skirt walks up and sets it down. As I’m taking the hanger off, She says, “so I was wondering if there’s any flexibility on the price? Because I’m just going to use the fabric and it seems like a lot to just use some of the fabric.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I thought she was joking, then I realized she really didn’t recognize me as the person she had just spoken to and was quite serious. I just laughed and said, “really? You just told me that this was at least $18 worth of fabric and what a great buy it was.”&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"So this happened yesterday, I was just too tired when I got home to post it.

I was working the customer service counter at work and had this woman (total non-Karen type, friendly, joking with me) and 3 teenagers (T1, T2, T3) come up. She wanted to buy some cigarettes. No problem. So she looks at her phone and reads it out. Again, not that uncommon, Canada recently changed the packaging requirements for every brand, they all look identical now so you need to know the exact name. After years and years of just having to worry about the color and brand, it's taking some getting used to, even a year and a half later. It's a reflex. So some people, especially people that only smoke occasionally, have the name of their preferred cigarettes saved in their phones.

Anyway, she lists off the brand, size, etc, all the info I need, and as I am heading to the correct drawer, I hear the words that make me stop dead. ""I don't know, I don't smoke"". Then this exchange ensues where she transformed into Karen before my very eyes:

M: ""I'm sorry, I can't sell them to you then. I would need to ID the person they are for.""

K: ""Are you serious? They're for my girl friend, she's having a rough day, I said I would pick up some smokes for her.""

M: ""I'm sorry, but once I ask for ID I need to see it and once I know that they are not for the purchaser, I need to see the ID for the one they are for.""

K: ""Even if I go to another store?""

M: ""I have no control over other stores. I just cannot legally sell them to you now that I now they are not for you""

K: ""This is \*&amp;%$ing ridiculous, she's 36 years old!""

T1: ""Mom, it's the law, she can't sell them to you because she has no proof that they are not for someone under 19. For all she knows you could be buying them for one of us""

K: (still complaining) ""Fine, we'll go somewhere else. It's still stupid""

I couldn't hear all of what he was saying to her after, but before they were out of ear shot he was still trying to explain that it was the law and I was only doing my job.

Not 5 minutes later a gentleman came in asking for the exact same cigarettes. He was paying cash. I have zero doubts that he was her husband, but I can't prove that. He didn't say that they were for anyone else, he was polite, paid and went on his way.

Just for clarification, there are some brands that we sell a lot of, some that we hardly sell at all and some that land somewhere in the middle. This was one of the middle brands.

Background: I worked for over 6 years in a big box retailer in the southern US. 3 of those years was in a Supervisory capacity over the cashiers, this also included making decisions on questionable returns. This story is from my supervisor days and it is about two years old.

One day I’m working and at the customer service counter we have 2 ladies, Crazy Couponer 1 (CC1) and Crazy Couponer 2 (CC2). They bring in multiple shopping bags full of over the counter(OTC) pharmacy, makeup, Health and Beauty Aids(HBA), there were hundreds of individual items.As per policy they have 5 different receipts for these items, when we look at the receipts all the items being returned were bought with coupons. As per policy we had to refund the price of the coupon as well, meaning even though they did not pay full price for item they got the full price back as a return. Normally this is not a problem, but these ladies had hundreds over 5 transactions and because of the departments they were from all most of the items had to tagged to be processed as reclamations, they could not go back on the shelf.

Now for the those of you think that’s not so bad, it took me and 2 customer service workers over 2 hours to process all this, they were scanning and I was tagging. We ended up with an entire cart full of merchandise that was going to be thrown away. I was wore out by the time this over, but I definitely feel like we were used as a bank. Even when I asked management specifically the manager over protecting our assets, including money, she said we had to follow policy and our hands were tied.

Edit: Thanks so much for your input, I do want clarify that this happened about 2 years ago and as I far as I know no one was punished for what happened. Another thing these returns had taken away time that could have been spent on other customers needing to do returns as these customers took up both of registers and made it harder for us to help other customers. Also I knew there was gonna be a problem right away and asked management’s input and they told me to go  ahead, also cue r/ malicious compliance. I even asked asset protection manager as a second opinion and they also told me to go ahead.

Edit 2: Please do not try this at any stores,

Another thing these returns had taken away time that could have been spent on other customers needing to do returns as these customers took up both of registers and made it harder for us to help other customers. Also I knew there was gonna be a problem right away and asked management’s input and they told me to go  ahead, also cue r/ malicious compliance. I even asked asset protection manager as a second opinion and they also told me to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Please do not try this at any stores, 
1. This happened 2 years ago 
2. Could be considered illegal depending on local laws 
3. Most stores are probably wise to this scam by now&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I work at a drug store, third shift. Today we had a customer come in saying that a woman was slumped over and unresponsive in her car. I went out and knocked until she rose and asked if she was okay. She said she was, and I asked if she needed me to call someone for her. She said no, and I took her cart in.

A few minutes later, our newspaper deliverer comes in and says that the woman is slumped over again and that we may need to call 911 (he had been coming in as I was going out to check on her).

So I call 911 and explain that a woman is not responding well and keeps passing out, almost like she's having a stroke or something. I remain outside as dispatch sends an ambulance and I point her out. As they are trying to get her to cooperate enough to get onto a stretcher, a firetruck and several police cars pull up. The police check her for alcohol or drug use to ensure she's not overdosing or under the influence. In the process, an officer takes her purse and keys and sets them on the roof of the car, as the woman is constantly rummaging through her purse while the police are trying to talk to her and her car is started and running.

Suddenly she's on the phone yelling ""*they took my purse, they stole my purse!*"" Her husband comes barreling in to the scene in a pickup, stopping just short of hitting the officers, and embraces his wife. He asks where her purse is, and the officers tell him it's on the roof of the car.

The husband makes a beeline for the purse as the officers tell him to stop and that he's impeding an investigation. When he doesn't stop, he's slammed into the car and put in handcuffs. His wife is screaming at them to stop and to not arrest him, and they're trying to let her know that he's not under arrest, he's just being detained for obstruction. 

They get her back in the car and are trying to explain to her the reason they showed up. She jabs her finger in my direction as she's going on incoherently, and the only thing I hear her say is ""*I am never shopping here again!*"" The officer continues to attempt to reason with her, to try to explain that we called for her well being and we're concerned, but she was too upset to listen. They ended up letting the husband take the wife home.

The officer later came in and explained to me that the woman was under the influence of prescription medication, and that she was not allowed to be operating a motor vehicle while using it. They let me know that it's the same as driving drunk, and to please call again if she exhibits similar symptoms, as she is a regular.

,TalesFromRetail,"So this is a story from my first job ever. For some backstory, I worked at a department storefor three years and was working in the lawn and garden/tolls section of the store. Took me some time to get use to it and learning about the specs for the merchandise was a bit of a pain but I managed with the help from my coworkers and they are awesome (miss them like crazy since I left but I do contact them from time to time.)

Story time. I've been working there for a year and a half by the time and a pretty big snow storm was about to hit the next few days so we had a lot of people in the store wanting snow throwers, shovels etc. Outside the store chained up were some returned/used snow throwers at a lower price but they make us some decent commission, more if a protection plan was added. This guy comes in and since I wasn't with anyone at the moment, our cashier directed him to me for help. He comes up to me asking if I could help with a snow thrower outside and I said sure. Jerk, as to what I'll refer to him by now going forward, started out decent in the beginning and was somewhat impressed that I knew better ways to take care of the snow thrower (thank you V (not using his full name) those extra details helped a lot.)

Jerk said he needed to check something else in the store but told me he'd come back to me when he was finished for the sale. I said sure thing and placed a sold sign on it. About 15 minutes later he comes back and asks for me to finish the sale. I rung him up with no PP (protection plan) since, I gotten this a lot, ""his friend is a mechanic."" Didn't hurt my numbers much since I had sold a much more expensive model with a 3yr plan.

The sale is done and I go with him to unlock it for since it was chained and had a security tag on it (no clue how that helped but I didn't care much) him and he asks if I can get a wrench to loosen the bolts. We go inside and this is where he went from kind to a jerk.

Jerk: ""So what about it's horsepower? How much does it have?""

Me: ""Snow throwers don't go by HP they go by CC.""

Jerk: ""But do you know the conversion?""

Me: ""No not really.""

Jerk: ""So you don't know much else about the machine then? Just the basics and a bit more how to maintain it.""

Me, now knowing where this is going but trying to stay polite: ""Sorry but when it comes to more details like what you're asking me, I don't really know much else.""

This dude didn't go livid or anything like that, but was annoyed. He started insulting my knowledge, calling me an idiot and then said the company hired me because they were sorry for me. I normally am a very patient person, not wanting to argue unless I have to and I never been in an actual fight but I can hold my own if need be. Almost was in one though but that was before I worked there and that would be another story if I ever remember the details.

Also I was hired there cause my older brother worked for them also as a store manager, so there was reputation with our name at the store. Him being a store manager and me being one of the top sellers for my department. The manager who hired me didn't know we were brothers until he saw our last name and this was after he said I was hired.

Anyway, I was done with this guy and I told him also. I went back inside with him demanding the wrench to loosen the bolts but I told him no and tossed it back in to our tool box. He was annoyed and demanded a manager which the cashier called to get him to shut up and out of the store. Another coworker went with the wrench and loosened it for him. About 5 minutes later my managers came to the front of the store and asked Jerk what was wrong and he told them. However, my coworkers heard the insults and told the managers what he said. They called me over the PA system as I was away from the check-out and away from him. I went over and this is what I came back to:

M1: ""You need to apologize to my associate right now. How dare you insult him while he's been nothing but kind and patient to you. We don't take kindly to customers being rude to them""

Jerk: -somewhat half-assed- ""Sorry""

Me: ""Apology accepted.""

M2: ""Good, now you may leave. We are done dealing with you.""

The guy left shaking his head and I thought he was muttering to himself but I didn't care anymore. My managers came up to me and said to not worry about him and that it was a smart idea to get away from him incase the situation escalated. They know that I have a lot of patience but even I have my limits. We spoke for a few minutes so I can just get that jerk out of my mind and my floor manager, who is a nice Jamaican older woman and the one who mainly spoke to Jerk, said ""I hope that thing breaks while he's using it. He didn't buy a plan right?"" I shake my head and she said ""Good cause I don't want him here or the repair center at all.""

I had a smile on my face for the rest of the shift. That remains my favorite moment of my life to this day. I currently work in a supermarket since I didn't return to the sporting goods store cause of the pandemic and my manager there is pretty chill also and I told him the story and said that he'd do the same if that ever happened. I had a smug smile the whole time typing this out.

Edit: it was a 2 stage snowblower. For some reason I’ve just been calling them snow throwers despiste the subtle differences even a little before I left the company due to work becoming scarce. And with the horsepower part, the snowblower was about 160cc and even then I didn’t remember the conversion but it’s around 5hp.

Edit 2: For those wondering how I know I can hold my own in a fight without ever being in one, my father was a soldier for his country and even took commando training. My brother took karate when we were younger and has been in a fight or two so they both taught me a few things. 

Edit 3: I’m thankful for everyone whose upvoted this story and even those who awarded it! Thanks again! I’ll post another story in the near future.

For some backstory, I worked at a department storefor three years and was working in the lawn and garden/tolls section of the store. Took me some time to get use to it and learning about the specs for the merchandise was a bit of a pain but I managed with the help from my coworkers and they are awesome (miss them like crazy since I left but I do contact them from time to time.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story time. I&amp;#39;ve been working there for a year and a half by the time and a pretty big snow storm was about to hit the next few days so we had a lot of people in the store wanting snow throwers, shovels etc. Outside the store chained up were some returned/used snow throwers at a lower price but they make us some decent commission, more if a protection plan was added. This guy comes in and since I wasn&amp;#39;t with anyone at the moment, our cashier directed him to me for help. He comes up to me asking if I could help with a snow thrower outside and I said sure. Jerk, as to what I&amp;#39;ll refer to him by now going forward, started out decent in the beginning and was somewhat impressed that I knew better ways to take care of the snow thrower (thank you V (not using his full name) those extra details helped a lot.)&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"To give a little background, I work in a small store that specializes in pet supplies. There are 3 locations that all sell the same items (more or less).


 One of the things we sell is birdseed. It comes in jugs or bags. The bag is more than double the volume of the jug, but less than $5 more in price. 


We received 8 jugs and 2 bags of birdseed today and my colleague called a customer who had requested we put a couple aside for her. He said he had to leave a voicemail, as the customer didn't answer her phone. About an hour after my colleague left for the day, I received a call from the customer's husband. The following is the conversation I had with him.


Me: We received our shipment today, and wanted to confirm that you wanted 4 jugs. Is that still the case? You'd save money by purchasing the bag, instead. 

Husband: Can we get 5 jugs? I didn't save my jug the last time - I recycled it. Can it be delivered tomorrow along with our food? 

Me: I can certainly do that, but are you sure that's what you want? If you buy 2 bags, you're saving money and have roughly the same amount of birdseed. I can send you whatever you'd like. The food is ready to go...

Husband: I don't have the jug anymore. What's the price difference?

Me (Explain all the math - price savings as well as product volume. Also state that I can send 2 bags tomorrow as that's what I have to sell him.)

Husband: Oh! I'll take 5 bags, then. 

Me: Sir, I'm sorry. I have 2 bags physically here in the store that I can sell you if you want them all tomorrow.  

Husband: OK! I'll take 3 bags then! That and the dog food. 

Me (mentally hitting my head on the counter): Sure. I'll send you 3 bags. Your total for the three bags and food comes to [whatever amount]. If you're all set, I'll charge the card on file and my driver will see you tomorrow some time. 

Husband: Oh, yes. The credit card. Do you have my wife's card?

Me: Yes. It's on file. I'll charge it later today and she will receive an email receipt. 

Husband: Wonderful! We'll see you tomorrow.

Me: Have a great day!


I called the location closest to the customer's address. Luckily they had a couple of bags come in, so they were able to supply the missing bag.

,TalesFromRetail,"So I work at a craft store chain with several stores in the area. I'm a cashier, but since we have so many cashiers I often work on the floor when we aren't as busy. Thanks to C-19, we've been having slow incomes of stock pilled on top of customers buying more supplies than usual since they are stuck at home having to do crafts. To set today's scene, I was returning items to the shelves when I got stopped by an interesting customer. 

C : Customer

Me : Me

CK1 : Customer's Kid 1

CK2 : Customer's Kid 2

OSW : Other Store Worker

OSM : Other Store Manager 


C : Hello, do you have this style of yarn in stock? 
Me : Let me check! 

C shows me her phone and I find the item that's on our app. There's a skew there which I look up, and it shows that we are out. 

Me : I'm sorry, it looks like we are out of that yarn. 

C : Do you have any in overstock? 

Me : No, we do not, our list of stock details all stock, including overstock. 

C : *sigh* When will you be getting more?!


Now, I need to emphasize that processing is not my field of study in this job, as I am normally a cashier. But I do know that we get new shipments in on Mondays, but yarn has been coming in increasingly sparingly and we haven't gotten many new shipments in a while due to low supply. 


Me : Due to delays and low stock thanks to the pandemic, we are not able to tell when any new shipments of that yarn will arrive. 

C, beginning to look frusterated : Are you SURE there isn't any in overstock?!?

Me : I'm positive. We do not even have an overstock location set for this type of yarn, as we haven't had overstock for it yet. 

As we are having this beginning to be repetitive conversation, CK1 and CK2 arrive out of nowhere. CK1 asks her mother a question.

CK1 : Moooommm, I need to go to the bathroom. 

C : Have CK2 take you! 

CK2 : But I don't know where the bathroom is...

Keep in mind, these two children are young. The oldest, CK2, looks to be maybe 5 years old, while CK1 is about 3 years old or so. 

Me : The bathroom is right around this corner! *I point the direction*

C, shooing her kids off : Yeah, yeah, go. *switches back to me* Are there any other stores that may have the yarn?!

Me : ...I can check. Can you please give me a moment? *checks scan gun for other store availability* It looks like nearly every single store in the nearby vicinity is out as well. Though there is Random Town (RT) that's across the city which may have a few-

C : But that's so far!!! I don't want to drive out that far! 

At this point I'm trying to stay as silent as I can. I'm not very confrontational at all and tried to let the situation calm down as it could. C was beginning to look really infuriated from such a small thing, and I wasn't one to fuel the flames.

Me : I understand your frustrations, but I've checked every single store that could possibly be nearby and every single one is out of stock except for RT. 

C : Fiiiiine, but I'm going to call them to make sure they have it. 

I'll spare the most of the 10 minutes she had me help her set up a call with the other store. She insisted I stay and help her call, even when I had maNY other things I could do instead. During this time, her children had returned and were clearly desperate for their mother's attention, but C was physically shooing them off because this call was apparently more important. Eventually, C got on the phone with the other store after calling 3 times. 

C : Hello, can you check if you have this specific yarn in stock? I have the skew number here. 

OSW (Other Store Worker) : Sorry, we aren't able to do that since we are busy right now and don't have anyone avalible on the floor to check that. 

C : But I need to see if you have this yarn before I drive all the way out there! 

OSW : There isn't anyone avalible to check for you right now. 

C, now visibly frusterated : Can I speak to the manager?!

OSW : ...I'm gonna put you on hold.

C, once put on hold, addresses me : (Craft Store) has terrible customer service! 

At this point, I am baffled. C has now just addressed me, a customer service member of said craft store, complaining about the customer service of said craft store. In that moment, I had no clue how to respond and simply awkwardly nodded. What kind of response was I supposed to give?! I want nothing more than to get out of this. And, to be fair, I should of. But I was too awkward to ask to leave. So, for 5 agonizing minutes on hold, I sat with C and her energetic children begging for attention. Eventually though, the Other Store's Manager (OSM) picked up the call. 

OSM : Hello? 

C : Hi there. Can you check if you have this item in stock?

OSM : *checks* I'm sorry, we do not have any of that yarn in stock. 

C : But I'm at a different store and it says you do have it in stock! 

OSM : Sometimes the system incorrectly puts in the number in stock when mixing up returns. Our apologizes. 

C : Are you suRE?!

OSM : Yes, I'm sure. 

C hangs up and turns back to me. I'll spare the next 15 minutes, but I managed to negotiate and look at other yarn she may also need for her project and see if she can get that yarn first. It took many more gruelling minutes of shifting through every single isle of yarn we had, but I eventually helped her get a cart full of yarn for her project. As soon as we finished, I was called up to the register to assist with the line. It was extremly hard to hide the visible relief on my face. 

Though, this isn't the end of C's story. Luckily enough, even though we had 3 cashier's at the registers, I was (un)lucky enough to get C back at my register when she went up to pay. Her kids were still running around but C didn't even look in their direction. I was desperate never to see C's face again so I quickly rang her up. The trouble began near the end of the transaction. 

C : *shows me a coupon*

Me : I'm sorry, we no longer accept competitors coupons. 

C : Since when?!

Me : Since last March. There are several signs placed around the registers. (I point her towards one)

C : Do you have any other coupons? 

Me : We have a 20% off coupon on our website! 

C : Do you have anything better than that?!

Me : *explains all possible options we have for discounts at our store*

C : Can I just....can I...AuGH! *grabs her purse and kids* Can you put it on hold? 

Me : Uh...sure...wait-

Before I could stop her, C nearly ran out of the store with her kids in tow. I tried to stop her to let her know that I needed a name and phone number to put it on hold, but she was gone before I knew it. I was now sitting at my register with an entire cart full of yarn that I spent 30 minutes helping this lady find, only for her to run out the store and demand I put it on hold.

,TalesFromRetail,"So I used to work at a video game store a while back. We would take games and systems in for trade.

One day, a woman and her son came in and wanted to trade in the son's Nintendo DS to get something else.

""Sure thing, I can do that for you!"" I say as I take the DS. I power it on to test it out (as we do with all system trades) and it plays a startup jingle like most electronics. After I hear the jingle, I smile, and say, ""Happy Birthday!"" to the boy. (Some of you already know why I said this, if you don't, it will become clear later)

The boy's eyes widened in wondrous amazement, and he turned to his mom and said, ""How'd he know it was my birthday?!"" with a big smile on his face.

His mother, however, did not have a smile on her face. It was a scowl.

""How did you know it's his birthday?"" she asked inquisitively.

I started to respond, ""Well, the DS has-"" but was cutoff by her.

""Are you the one who's been stalking us?"" she said.

""Excuse me?"" I responded. I was quite taken aback.

""You're the one who's been stalking us! I'm calling the cops!"" she yelled. She ripped the DS from my hands and grabbed her son's hand and left the store. She turned to the left and went almost out of view and pulled out her phone. I couldn't hear what she was saying on the phone.

I should also point out that I was working by myself at the time, and there had been one other customer in the store near the back. She naturally heard everything (the store was rather small) and came up to inquire as to what happened.

I say, ""I don't know; she just freaked out when I said 'Happy Birthday' to her son and said she was calling the cops.""

She responded, ""Oh, so she doesn't know about the DS jingle?""

""Evidently not. I mean, I feel for her if she's got some issue or something, but yeah, she just kinda flipped out there.""

I checked her out, just buying some PS3 games, and I happened to see her trying to talk to the woman when she left. It looked like she was trying to convince her that it was a misunderstanding, but the woman wasn't having it. She stood there indignantly with her son, waiting.

I could have gone out to try to explain it to her but I thought that it might make things worse, so I decided against it.

A little while later, another customer came in, and as they opened the door, I heard the mother say, ""He's a stalker in there!""

The guy was obviously confused, and he happened to be a regular.

""What's that about?"" Reg asked me.

""Just a wild misunderstanding on her part,"" I say. I explain what happened and we both chuckled.

Assuming a cop would come to investigate, I prepared for their arrival by getting out a used DS to demonstrate the misunderstanding.

A few minutes later, I see a squad car turn up. The officer came up to the woman and led her away from the store as he took her statement. Reg and I were just waiting for him to come in.

Eventually, he did so.

""Lady said you're stalking her?"" he asked, with a slight inclination that he didn't believe her, I'm guessing she was rambling or something when telling her story.

""Sorry, Officer... (I look to his name badge) Brown. My name's Knever, and it's really just a silly misunderstanding on her part. She told you I said 'Happy Birthday' to her son, right?""

He nods.

""Well, the only reason I figured it was his birthday was because they wanted to sell their Nintendo DS, and there's this feature...""

I pull out the DS and motion to it.

""See, when you turn it on, it plays this little jingle..."" I turn it on and it plays the jingle.

""Now, the thing is, if you turn it on on the birthday that was set by the user..."" I go into the settings and change the birthday to the current day, and turn it off.

""... the jingle that plays on startup is noticeably different,"" and turn it on and it plays the special birthday jingle. ""That's the only reason I knew it was his birthday.""

Officer Brown seems to understand. He takes my information and thanks me and leaves. I see him go out to the parking and talk with the mother. She seems displeased at first but appears at ease after Brown demonstrates on the kid's DS what had happened. Even though she's calmed down, he appears to urge her not to come back in the store and leave.

Reg and I had quite a laugh after Brown left.

Believe it or not, I've had a similar experience before this, wherein the mom actually let me explain, and she, the kid, and I were all happily amused.",t2_e3928,False,,0,False,Today's my birthday.

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, I see a squad car turn up. The officer came up to the woman and led her away from the store as he took her statement. Reg and I were just waiting for him to come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lady said you&amp;#39;re stalking her?&amp;quot; he asked, with a slight inclination that he didn&amp;#39;t believe her, I&amp;#39;m guessing she was rambling or something when telling her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, Officer... (I look to his name badge) Brown. My name&amp;#39;s Knever, and it&amp;#39;s really just a silly misunderstanding on her part. She told you I said &amp;#39;Happy Birthday&amp;#39; to her son, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He nods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, the only reason I figured it was his birthday was because they wanted to sell their Nintendo DS, and there&amp;#39;s this feature...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pull out the DS and motion to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See, when you turn it on, it plays this little jingle...&amp;quot; I turn it on and it plays the jingle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, the thing is, if you turn it on on the birthday that was set by the user...&amp;quot; I go into the settings and change the birthday to the current day, and turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... the jingle that plays on startup is noticeably different,&amp;quot; and turn it on and it plays the special birthday jingle. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the only reason I knew it was his birthday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officer Brown seems to understand. He takes my information and thanks me and leaves. I see him go out to the parking and talk with the mother. She seems displeased at first but appears at ease after Brown demonstrates on the kid&amp;#39;s DS what had happened. Even though she&amp;#39;s calmed down, he appears to urge her not to come back in the store and leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reg and I had quite a laugh after Brown left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I&amp;#39;ve had a similar experience before this, wherein the mom actually let me explain, and she, the kid, and I were all happily amused.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I work at a local nameless music store in my town. Idk if it's a gift or a 6th sense or something, but I usually get a gut feeling when dealing with a customer is gonna go south. She gave me this feeling. She walked in with her son and I think a friend?

She's about middle aged. Not joking, Karen haircut, and she looks like twice my weight. At first, she was polite and pretty normal. She was picking up her son's clarinet that she had dropped off to be cleaned and checked over. Grabbed the case for it, set it on the counter and began to ring her up. We have these checklists that are marked with everything the tech did to the instrument, and I'm supposed to read it to them and then let them keep the copy. So I say that we Cleaned &amp; Wiped down, etc. Everything's going fine, but just before she's about to pay, she asks me to get a q-tip. I don't really think twice about it, and run and get her a q-tip.

I'm just about to close it up when she digs the q-tip into one of the holes of the clarinet and pulls it up and goes ""Does that look clean to you?""

Me: Well I guess not, lemme see, looks like you only got it cleaned and wiped down. Did you want it to be disassembled? (disassembled &amp; deep cleaned)

CCL: Well, I wanted it cleaned!

Me: We had it cleaned and wiped down, says right here.

CCL: Well, you didn't clean the whole thing!

Me: We didn't disassemble it looks like. I can put it back in the shop and have the tech give it the extra treatment.

CCL: I don't want that, that'll take too long blah blah blah, just don't charge me for the cleaning!

Me: lemme talk to my co-worker, see what I can do.

Talk to my co worker, we decide to call the owner. Basically the next like fucking hour of my life was hell. It blended all together of me trying to stay calm and polite, calling my boss back and forth, and trying to tell the lady the same fucking thing over and over again. Some highlights:

My boss told me to stone wall, so there were about 10 minutes where we were just standing there. I interrupted this silence eventually by reminding her that we were closing in 30 minutes.

She kept telling me these random sob stories out of nowhere, something about a broken down SUV, hospital bills, whatever. At this point, I fucking hated her guts and hoped that she wasn't lying and it was just karma.

I handed the store phone to her so she could speak directly to the owner. They argued for about 5 minutes, but the owner's been doing this a while so he had her figured out. She threatened to walk out of the store WITH the clarinet, WITHOUT paying. Boss immediately hung up, she slammed the phone into the counter, boss calls the store again, I answer, he tells me that she can't leave the store with the clarinet if she doesn't pay, and that I NEED TO HAVE TO BEHIND THE COUNTER NOW. \*Phew\* ok I know what to do.

The clarinet case is sitting right there in front of her meat hooks. I take the repair checklist, and show it to her. ""Now if you look here, we did clean it."" and I grab the case by the handle. Fuck, not quick enough, she realizes she's been duped and grabs the case with her grubby little claws. Fuck, it's on now. I'm trying to control my anger, and not overpower her in any way, I don't want to give her any ammunition. She threatens to call the police, I reply that we will as well, she FUCKING FINALLY throws down her card onto the counter and I fucking run her bill.

She said she would contest the charge, she never did. Haven't seen her again.  I ordered a sandwich just before she showed up and I still hadn't got around to eating it.

I work at a craft store,  I am the cashier, the customer I'll refer to as C

Being a cashier it's my job to answer the phone even when I'm with a customer. This event happened when I was not only with a customer but had a line of them.

I answer the phone, ever so politely 
""___ crafts, how may I assist you""
C mumbles into the phone, ""yes do you have any darning thread?""
I had to have him repeat this three times because he was mumbling so bad but finally I understand
""I'm not sure, let me ask someone on the floor just a moment"" 
I ask into my headset and a manager responds that no, we do not
""I'm sorry sir but we don't carry that""
C-""well maybe you should ask someone smarter?""
He had more to say but the second he got the word smarter out I interrupted him 
""I asked my manager"" 
C-""oh, so what would you say I should do to repair a hole in a sock?"" A simple question but his tone was very condescending 

""Any type of good cotton thread should work""
C- AGAIN ""how about you ask someone who k owns what they're talking about!?""
So I ask my manager, she says the exact same thing, I relay the message
""My manager also says any type of good cotton thread will work""

,TalesFromRetail,"I (27M) worked at a local grocery store from 16-23 before graduating from university and was a well known employee by most all of our customers. I had maybe 4 negative encounters throughout my 7 year stint there, but because we were extremely customer oriented I would bend over backwards even for the worst of our patrons. Keeping my mouth shut for so long in a customer service job had finally caught up to me when I knew I was about to triple my income overnight. 

I had accepted a job and was going to be moving out of state in a week when this happened. I was off of work for the day, but my mother needed some groceries picked up and I decided to go get them for her. The parking lot of our store was on a slope and we often had issues of runaway carts hitting cars. It usually wasn’t a big deal and people would leave a note indicating what happened with their number. 

As I’m packing up the car with my bags I look over and see a kid riding the cart down the parking lot and I let out a chuckle (come on, everyone does it). My laugh immediately stopped when I noticed he was going full speed towards a pretty beaten down car that happened to belong to one of my coworkers. He hit it full force and left a sizable dent in the drivers side door. His mother appeared out of nowhere, looked around, and quickly took the cart to the area where we store them. 

I’m sitting in my car watching this happen thinking: “Please God leave a note. Please don’t make me say something.” Sure enough she gets back to her car and opens the drivers side door. 

Me: You are going to leave a note aren’t you?!

Lady: What?

Me: Your kid hit that car and left a mark. You need to do something about it. 

Lady: Mind your own business it’s not even noticeable and I don’t have paper or a pen to write my information down on!

Me: If you’re not going to say something then I am. 

At this point I lost it. Mainly because I only had a week left working there and because I realized I was at the store, but not wearing my work attire and had dreamed of a moment like this for years. 

Me: You’re good with teaching your kid it’s okay to damage someone’s property and not take responsibility for it?! What kind of person does that?! What kind of role model are you being? You need to go in the store and tell someone!

Lady: Leave me alone! I’m leaving. 

At this point I get out of my car and start walking towards hers. 

She gets in, rolls the window down, flips me the bird, yells “Fuck you!” and speeds off. 

I got a picture of her license plate and told our store manager and the employee what had happened. His insurance took care of it, but I wish she had to pay some kind of price.

Keeping my mouth shut for so long in a customer service job had finally caught up to me when I knew I was about to triple my income overnight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had accepted a job and was going to be moving out of state in a week when this happened. I was off of work for the day, but my mother needed some groceries picked up and I decided to go get them for her. The parking lot of our store was on a slope and we often had issues of runaway carts hitting cars. It usually wasn’t a big deal and people would leave a note indicating what happened with their number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’m packing up the car with my bags I look over and see a kid riding the cart down the parking lot and I let out a chuckle (come on, everyone does it). My laugh immediately stopped when I noticed he was going full speed towards a pretty beaten down car that happened to belong to one of my coworkers. He hit it full force and left a sizable dent in the drivers side door. His mother appeared out of nowhere, looked around, and quickly took the cart to the area where we store them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting in my car watching this happen thinking: “Please God leave a note. Please don’t make me say something.” Sure enough she gets back to her car and opens the drivers side door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: You are going to leave a note aren’t you?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Your kid hit that car and left a mark. You need to do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: Mind your own business it’s not even noticeable and I don’t have paper or a pen to write my information down on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: If you’re not going to say something then I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I lost it. Mainly because I only had a week left working there and because I realized I was at the store, but not wearing my work attire and had dreamed of a moment like this for years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: You’re good with teaching your kid it’s okay to damage someone’s property and not take responsibility for it?! What kind of person does that?! What kind of role model are you being? You need to go in the store and tell someone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady: Leave me alone! I’m leaving. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I get out of my car and start walking towards hers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets in, rolls the window down, flips me the bird, yells “Fuck you!” and speeds off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a picture of her license plate and told our store manager and the employee what had happened. His insurance took care of it, but I wish she had to pay some kind of price. &lt;/p&gt;

I work in a home improvement store. It's a typical day where it's not exactly power hour but it's not like I'm walking around without anything to do.

A lady walks ups to me and gets my attention. One very important thing to note is that this lady is Asian. She had broken English but I'm going to be putting the proper grammar here.

Me: ""Hi, how can I help?""

Lady: ""Yes, I'm looking for this.""

She holds out her phone to me. Now this happens quite often as people either want to show a picture, or perhaps they don't speak good English. I live in an area that has a lot of Spanish speakers but also a hefty Asian community (mostly Chinese-Mandarin).

She's brought up a text message, and I cannot read it. I barely remember what it was exactly (which is why I didn't know if I wanted to post this story) but I remember 100% that it started with ""La"" and then followed by a word that I believe was something like ""Cabilla"". Note this wasn't the actual word used, but it's what my coworkers thought maybe she was trying to look for (more on that later).

My Spanish is mediocre at best. I took Spanish in High School but forming sentences is something I'm not confident in. Only thing I'm good at is numbers and recognizing certain characters.  I try to learn from my coworkers bit by bit and we have fun with me trying to learn.

Me: ""Oh, sorry Ma'am, I don't speak Spanish. I can find you an employee who does.""

The Lady then looks at me like I just took my shirt off and started screaming while she watches me from the other side of a street.

Lady: ""Do you speak English?""

My brain short circuited in that moment. I couldn't comprehend what I just heard. I'm so thankful I had a mask on because I couldn't hold back my mouth from expressing the ""what the fudge?"" state. You all know the one.

When my brain started back up, which to me felt like a good minute, I say back: ""Uh... I do Ma'am. I'm speaking it right now. I just spoke to you in English before."" I rarely ever make a snappy comment like that, both because of anxiety and my attempts at professionalism. This was a line I never thought could have been crossed though. 

Lady: ""So do you have this? Read it! It's English!"" She holds out her phone again.

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I do not know what that is. Because that is not English, or at least any word that I have heard of. I can try to find another employee who might know what that is.""

She then shakes her head. ""Why does no one speak English here?!"" She walks away in a huff.

I'm left there flabbergasted. Eventually I'm able to maneuver myself to some coworkers who spoke Spanish, and I tell them about what happened. They're also shocked, but when I asked them what those words meant (when I actually had fresh in my mind what the words were) none of them could identify what she wanted. They reaffirm to me though that use of ""La"" was most likely Spanish. I eventually find a coworker who theorizes that perhaps she was looking for rebar - which they tell me ""Cabilla"" is an iron or steel bar - but the Lady (or someone else who sent that to her) had wrote it down wrong. 

I've dealt with some customers before, but this was just mind boggling to me. I can only assume perhaps they mistook the use of the Latin Alphabet to automatically assume it was English. 

I don't hold any kind of negative thoughts to this person. I'm very uneducated in regards to identifying languages myself. I understand the struggle of learning a new language in a new country since I did that myself when I lived in South Korea for a few years.

I've moved on from this job a long time ago now so please do forgive me if some of the details are a bit hazy, but here's the gist.

A  couple of blokes from eastern Europe came in wanting to buy a kettle, and asking what the options were for them to pick it up later. One of them did not speak (I suspect his English was not good). The other had reasonable English. I explained that they could pick it up right away as we had them in stock. If they wanted to, they could pick it up later in the day from click-and-collect, or for a fee we could deliver it to their address provided the address was in the UK or Ireland. They chose the delivery option.

I put in the details of what they wanted to buy to the computer, and came to the section where I had to put in delivery details. That was where the fun began. The conversation went something like this.

Me: ""Could I ask your address please?""

Moron: ""Why do you want to know my address?""

Me: ""Because you said you want it delivered.""

Moron: ""But why do you need to know my address?""

Me: ""That is how we know where to deliver your package. Otherwise we won't know where to deliver it.""

Moron: ""But it's your job to know these things.""

Me: ""It's my job to ask you. I'm not a psychic and I don't automatically know your address.""

Moron: ""But I don't feel comfortable giving my address out. I don't know you and I want to preserve my privacy.""

Me: ""I understand that sir, but if you won't give my your address then I can't have your kettle delivered to you. There are twenty million addresses in the UK and if I pick one at random chances are it won't be yours. Now either you can tell me your address, or you can pick it up at click-and-collect, or you can take it with you now.""

Moron: ""You're an idiot.""

At that point I had enough and his insult was a good enough pretext to end the conversation. I informed him I was not going to be taking personal abuse and that I would not be serving him further.

ANYWAY, my company is well-known for making expensive strategy games, and like many games that undergo reprints, our games get slight upgrades each print run. We might increase the thickness of the card stock. Or change up a faction's ability to make it more interesting. Or do a new mold for a monster so it's ankles are as thin, rendering it sturdier. Now, of course every business that makes products does this. No one expects the 2022 Acura TLX to be identical to the 2021 model. When Butterfingers got new packaging, it was fine. 

But for some reason, people who buy my games seem to feel that if I ever do a new edition of a game, they deserve it based on the fact they bought the original. I don't think this happens to other game companies. The most egregious case happened in 2019. An angry game nerd \[AGN\] came by the booth and said, ""I bought your &lt;expensive strategy game&gt; in 2013 and you've added new stuff."" 

""Yes,"" I said. ""That is true.""

AGN ""I need the most up to date version!"" 

""Great!"" I say. ""We have it for sale right here!""

""No!"" He said. ""My game is useless now. Give me the new copy. You can have my old one in exchange."" He held it up. Let's just say it had seen a lot of use. Don't get me wrong, it was still eminently playable, it was clearly a used item. Note: we do not sell used games. 

""Didn't you like my game?"" I ask.

AGN, a little more cheerful. ""Yes, it's my favorite.""

Me: ""Your game is literally just as fun as ever. The new version doesn't change yours at all."" 

Here it got interesting, I could visibly see the AGN realizing that he was unreasonable, and trying inside his head to stay angry. His basic problem is that he, like a lot of game nerds, was actually fairly intelligent, so it is harder to maintain the attitude.  

AGN, still trying to stay mad. ""So I'm just screwed, then is that it?""

Me: ""Your game is a first edition. A collector's item.""

AGN just scowls. Then, because I like to keep my fans happy, I offered to give him the upgraded monster model (the one with sturdy ankles) for free. The whole bus didn't applaud, but he diud hang around the booth for like 40 minutes then bought a $60 game.

,TalesFromRetail,"So I work at a chain of stores that offer discounts on monthly items with our membership. Sometimes people forget to pull up their membership when checking out and come to customer service after the fact complaining about missing out on their deals. The way our system works is we have to refund the entire transaction then rering it with the membership for them to get their savings. Recently, like some larger retailers, customer have been given the option to hook their cards up with their account so the discounts are applied when the card is inserted to pay and our network recognizes the member. This is already hit and miss on a normal day, but the weather across the us at the moment has led to all kinds of outages for us at the moment. 

A few nights ago I could see a customer starting to get upset at one of the registers. Like clock work they were at the customer service counter moments later. When the lady arrives she explains to me that normally her membership is pulled up with her debit card, but today it didn’t look like she had revived her savings. After pulling up her receipt, she was in fact right, and I apologies to her about the issue. I proceed to explain how I’ll have to refund everything in her order and rering it for her to get her discount and apologies for the inconvenience. Upset, and starting to get angry, she ask me how much she would have saved. After some calculations I find she would have saved less than half a dollar. This is normally the point that they say forget it and leave. Not here though. 

“Ok, go ahead. I’m not taking the items out of my bag though, that’s ridiculous.”

I explain to her again that to get her discount I’ll have to rering up every item and to do so will need to scan and weight all her purchases. 

“You have my receipt, why do you need my items?There is a list of all of them there.”

Somewhere in the midst of this the changes her focus from the return and rering to her berating us about her card not working. 

“I come in here all the time and this works every time. Someone needs to say something to that cashier because she didn’t apply my discounts.”

I explain to her than it’s an automated process and is out of the hands of the cashier. 

“Well then, explain to me why I’m having to go through all this mess than. Shouldn’t you all care about you customers.”

At this point I try and explain to her that with the weather that had recently hit some areas of the us we have been experiencing network outages all across the board. This has been effecting everything from our emails, to our payment processing, time clocks, all the way to our discounts. 

“No, that can’t be the reason. I still have internet at my house. If I have internet than it should work.”

I politely explain to her that we had heard from higher ups that some of our servers are based in Texas and that the weather had caused some of them to lose power. More importantly the servers having to do with our discounts had been going on and off line. 

“So you mean to tell me I didn’t get my discount because of snow. Wow, that’s an excuse I’ve never heard before.”

At this point I notice another customer walking up. Little did I know it was her husband. I can see them begin to whisper to each other. 

“So your telling me you’ve wasted my wife and my time because the weather. Please explain to me how snow makes the internet work? It’s not like the internet has to physically move anywhere. Quit making up excuses and give us our money.”

She chimes back in

“Look at this point either give me my money you owe me in cash or refund me and I’m keeping the groceries. I’m tired of this.”

By now I’m so tired of having two “grown adults” berate me because they don’t understand any basics of servers or how the internet works, so I bit the bullet. I ended up making them a gift card and apologizing again. Thankfully this shut them up long enough they decided to leave. 

Funny part is this wasn’t even the worst thing to happen that night.

,TalesFromRetail,"This happened years ago when I was working over nights at a 24 hour gas station. It was just south of a major interstate, so even at night there was plenty of business. 

First some basics about myself. I'm a guy 5'10"" about 185 at the time. I was in decent shape and 27 when this all happened. 

The night my story took place I was finishing up the training, of a new over night employee. They had her come in day for a week to learn the register and procedures. Then gave her to me for two nights to show her the ropes on over nights. 

We normally worked alone over night with her there I was expected to do things like stock the cooler, that you obviously couldn't do while alone. This gave her time to get used to watching the store, but I was close by if needed. 

While I was in the cooler she came over opened a display door and called out to me that there was a guy in the store with his ""richard"" hanging out. Sighing I told her I was on my way. 

In the minute it took me to get back out to the store area, the man had apparently tucked himself back in his pants and gone outside to talk to a pair of cabbies filling up their cabs. (This becomes important in a minute.)

I go outside to talk to the guy and get him away from the customers. As I get closer I hear him telling them that Christ has returned and he is been brought back to help spread the good word. Oh joy. He then goes on to tell them they don't need to pay for anything anymore. The proceeds to take the nozzles off the gas pumps, and lay them on the ground. 

Naturally I start picking them back up and putting them where they belong. When he sees me doing this he runs over to our sign with the gas prices and pulls out the number throwing them on the ground. 

Clearly this guy is a bag of mixed nuts, and it looks like he wants to go back into the store. This is a terrible idea to my mind because some body at out corporate level had sent display set of hand took (hammers, screwdrivers, and the like) out to the stores. So the last thing I want is this guy getting near a supply of bashing and stabbing implements. 

So my new game plan is to keep him outside after a quick call over my shoulder for the new employee to call the cops. (I found out later that when I did this both cabbies thought I was making the right call and hit their panic buttons.) 

So now our nut job has decided I'm the enemy, and trys to run past me to the store. I'm able to keep in Front of him, but he keeps getting closer to me. 

Finally he's close enough he grabs a hold of me trying to push me out of his way. I also had onto him. Thankfully we are about the same size, but I weigh more which allows me to keep him from going anywhere. Remember I just need him to stay put until the cops get there. 

I'm not sure what triggered him to say this but after about a minute of struggling with each other he tells me I'm not taking him anywhere. Probably stupidly I replayed I didnt want to take him anywhere just to keep him right where he was. 

I response he tried kicking me. Thankfully we were to close together for what he was trying and I used the opportunity to push him back. Not hard enough to make him fall, but enough to get him stumbling backwards to put more distance between him and the store. 

I kept this up until we reached the wood chips filled decorative area at the edge of the parking lot. He fell into it and a sat on him to keep him in place for the cops. 

I'm not sure how long we were like that, but he was punching me the whole time. One shot was good enough to knock out one of my contacts. The entire time he is doing this I block what I can, but out of fear for going to jail for beating ups crazy person I don't swing back. 

Finally gloriously the cops finally arrived. I say finally, beacuse while in reality it was probably only  couple of minutes from the 911 call to their arrival it felt much longer to me. Apparently because they had gotten not one but 3 911 calls in less than 30 seconds from out location (my fellow employee and the 2 cabbies) the cops had sent 4 cop cars each with 2 officers. 

When both I and the crazy guy see them we break apart. At with time he points at me and tell them to arrest me, I'm selling things. I can't imagine any Karen out there being any more convinced they were in the right than this guy, but his attitude changed in an instant when 4 of the officers moved towards him

2 other officers came to talk to me and look me over because I looked like I had just gotten out of a prize fight. While the last 2 officers went to take statements from my coworker and the cabbies. 

The full aftermath didnt hit right away. The man was arrested, he put up a hell of a fight with the cops. He was sent for a 30 day psych eval, and I found out later was committed by the state. 

The store GM lived about an hour away so she had the assistant manager come in to see if I was okay to finish my shift. I chose to work it. I wasn't going to let that guy beat me. 

The incident caused corporate to install the first gas station pay window in the town because of the beating I took. It was to the point the two cops talking to me asked me why I hadn't fought back, and I explained the reasons I mentioned above. To which on replied, given some of the dirt bag ambulance chasers out there it was probably the safer move. 

The company paid for my medical bills and even paid for replacement contracts. Except for some heavy bruises that called for some Tylenol with codeine I came out okay.

I did have to go through having a rather embarrassing set of pictures taken of my bruises by the cops. They did it in our back room while the assistant manager watched the store. 

The new employee decided she couldn't feel safe on nights and ended up working on second shift for about 6 months before changing stores.

As for me, it made me reevaluate my definition of crazy, because I realized that up till that day I had never seen the real thing.

&lt;p&gt;So now our nut job has decided I&amp;#39;m the enemy, and trys to run past me to the store. I&amp;#39;m able to keep in Front of him, but he keeps getting closer to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally he&amp;#39;s close enough he grabs a hold of me trying to push me out of his way. I also had onto him. Thankfully we are about the same size, but I weigh more which allows me to keep him from going anywhere. Remember I just need him to stay put until the cops get there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what triggered him to say this but after about a minute of struggling with each other he tells me I&amp;#39;m not taking him anywhere. Probably stupidly I replayed I didnt want to take him anywhere just to keep him right where he was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I response he tried kicking me. Thankfully we were to close together for what he was trying and I used the opportunity to push him back. Not hard enough to make him fall, but enough to get him stumbling backwards to put more distance between him and the store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept this up until we reached the wood chips filled decorative area at the edge of the parking lot. He fell into it and a sat on him to keep him in place for the cops. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how long we were like that, but he was punching me the whole time. One shot was good enough to knock out one of my contacts. The entire time he is doing this I block what I can, but out of fear for going to jail for beating ups crazy person I don&amp;#39;t swing back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally gloriously the cops finally arrived. I say finally, beacuse while in reality it was probably only  couple of minutes from the 911 call to their arrival it felt much longer to me. Apparently because they had gotten not one but 3 911 calls in less than 30 seconds from out location (my fellow employee and the 2 cabbies) the cops had sent 4 cop cars each with 2 officers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When both I and the crazy guy see them we break apart. At with time he points at me and tell them to arrest me, I&amp;#39;m selling things. I can&amp;#39;t imagine any Karen out there being any more convinced they were in the right than this guy, but his attitude changed in an instant when 4 of the officers moved towards him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 other officers came to talk to me and look me over because I looked like I had just gotten out of a prize fight. While the last 2 officers went to take statements from my coworker and the cabbies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full aftermath didnt hit right away. The man was arrested, he put up a hell of a fight with the cops. He was sent for a 30 day psych eval, and I found out later was committed by the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store GM lived about an hour away so she had the assistant manager come in to see if I was okay to finish my shift. I chose to work it. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to let that guy beat me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident caused corporate to install the first gas station pay window in the town because of the beating I took. It was to the point the two cops talking to me asked me why I hadn&amp;#39;t fought back, and I explained the reasons I mentioned above. To which on replied, given some of the dirt bag ambulance chasers out there it was probably the safer move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company paid for my medical bills and even paid for replacement contracts. Except for some heavy bruises that called for some Tylenol with codeine I came out okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have to go through having a rather embarrassing set of pictures taken of my bruises by the cops. They did it in our back room while the assistant manager watched the store. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new employee decided she couldn&amp;#39;t feel safe on nights and ended up working on second shift for about 6 months before changing stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, it made me reevaluate my definition of crazy, because I realized that up till that day I had never seen the real thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening, and sorry  for any spelling or grammar errors.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd been working there since I was 16, and continued to work there until I was 18. I'm autistic and cry when I'm super stressed or frustrated. I cant control it or hold it back, it just happens. 

This one fateful day it was nearing a holiday. Which holiday it was I cant remember, but the store was extremely busy. I arrived for my shift after being dropped off by the school bus, and clocked in. The front end manager instructed me to hop onto one particular register that was known to be one of the busiest. *great* I thought. I expected a wave of nonstop customers until I clocked out at 8pm. 

And so I proceeded to take customers. ""Hello! How are you? Did you find everything ok? Do you have your store card? Is their anything on the bottom of your card? Paper or plastic bags?""

This went on for a few hours, with most of the customers either helping me bag their items or insisting on bagging them all themselves. Some customers have a particular way they like their things bagged, and who am I to argue? 

About halfway through my shift, along came a couple with 2 carts overflowing with groceries. I already knew this wasnt going to be a quick transaction. And with no bagger available to help bag, that would mean I'd have to stop scanning to bag items. I started scanning their items and placing them in the bagging area. After one cart was empty and I had the majority scanned, the bagging area was piled high with groceries, and the man stood there watching me while his wife unloaded the other cart. He didnt help bag, didnt put any bags I did pack in his cart. Just watched me. 

Because of how busy the store was, I was trapped in my register and could not put the bags into the cart myself. 

Eventually I didnt have much room to put anything so I had to stand on my toes to try and reach a spit to put things. At one point I had to very lightly toss a loaf of bread on the top of the pile. This apparently was the wrong choice. 

Man: Excuse me, but why are you throwing my groceries? I'm paying good money for this sh!t. I dont need you breaking it all. 

Me: oh, I'm sorry sir. I hadnt realized I'd thrown it. I'll be more careful. Again, I apologize. 

I started to try and be extra careful with his groceries while I scanned. The pile kept growing and growing and he still did not bag anything. I placed another item on the pile, amd it caused a small landslide of groceries. 

Man: I TOLD YOU NOT TO THROW MY GROCERIES! GET YOUR MANAGER NOW!

I hit the button for my manager, amd she appeared within minutes. 

Manager: what's going on Pokemom?

Man: This little b!tch is throwing my items!

I'm not sure what happened after this, as I started crying. My manager told me to go to the bathroom and clean myself up and come back when I felt better.

,TalesFromRetail,"Read this forum for a while, thought I'd share something that happened a few weeks ago in my store.

I'm a manager in the deli of a large southern chain grocery store. I was heading back from lunch and cut through the international foods asile. There I saw this older man in army style khakis kinda hunched over his cart.

Because of his older age, my immediate concern was that something was wrong. I had a customer in my last deli job have a heart attack in the asile and die, so I guess I'm more susceptible to notice these things and feel concern. I started to slow down to check on him and see if he needed help.

However I saw that he had a bottle of soy sauce in one hand, and a large hunting knife in the other that hes using to cut open the bottle. My new concern is for the safety of everyone else. I mean this was a crocodile Dundee size knife. Given that I'm a smaller woman, I made the choice not to confront the man myself alone and used the head set to page for help. I said the there was a man in ""asile x"" with a huge knife opening bottles. The response I got was a baffled ""theres what?"" Nope, you didnt hear that wrong. Luckily for us, our store is frequented by lock firefighters and police officers. Two local firemen overheard me and came rushing over to see the guy. 

Immediately the yelling started. They told him to put away the weapon and he started yelling that he only wanted to ""test the sauces to find one he liked"". Turns out there was five already open bottles back on the shelf. The firefighters blocked off the sile to prevent other shoppers from getting near as the store manager told him he had to leave. Luckily an on duty cop had come in for dinner and stepped in to escort the man outside and remove him from the property while he hollered and shouted the whole time that he did nothing wrong.

We are still baffled to this day about just what that guy was thinking. We know use it to judge customer levels. ""Is he, you're out of x item crazy or using a knife to test the sauces crazy?""

,TalesFromRetail,"At the service desk my coworkers and I kept tally of the number of calls asking for various items after we sold out over the past four days. We had pretty bad weather of snow and freezing temps and it was all gone on the first day.

Ice melt/sand - 1,020  
Heaters - 860  
Shovels - 150  
Heat tape - 120  
Kerosene - 350  
If any of our other stores had it in stock (they didn't) - 1,350  
Sleds - 110 (Our store doesn't sell sleds)

We had to sometimes have a dedicated person on the phone to answer and say ""Hello, how can I help you."" ""No, we are sold out"" ""Your welcome"" on repeat back-to-back throughout the day.

Even worse is we have no idea when we'll have it back in stock. None of our night crew is able to come in because the melting snow freezes over so it's unsafe to have stocking employees drive to work over night. The delivery trucks can't make it over either.

**So please, next time you hear you're getting inclement weather, buy ahead of time and don't wait until it's too late!!!**

FYI: Not in Texas thank goodness. It's north of there where, surprisingly, this weather is actually kind of common.

Also, not trying to discredit my business here. We were pretty blindsided by how bad it was and how unprepared the customers were.

,TalesFromRetail,"For background, I work at a chain grocery store as a pick-up service employee, so most of my time is spent either in the back room, picking groceries, or taking them out to customers. However, we’re typically done picking groceries before 4:30, as the cutoff for order submissions is 4:00.

It was about 6:00 pm by this point, and it was only me and one other coworker there for the night. She was conditioning some things in a different area of the back room, and I was standing in front of the computer in case orders checked in. This puts me in direct view of the windows out to the store that are set in the doors to the back room. 

As I’m standing there, checking my phone, I hear the door open and turn sharply, confused. A man has WALKED INTO THE BACK ROOM, and he was not wearing a mask. Once fully inside the back room, he looks at me and asks, “Do you have any more gallons of sweet tea back here?” 

I’m very surprised and put off by this, so I tell him I’ll check. The walk in fridge that it would be in is around the corner, so I glance inside and see that it is not, in fact, in there. I go back and tell the man that we don’t have any back there. Very huffy, he walks out of the back room just as my coworker walks back towards me, very confused by the man leaving. 

This should have been the end of it. However, as I’m standing there, filling her in on what’s transpired while she was gone, the door slams open again, and both of us turn to look sharply. The man is back, still not wearing a mask, and brandishing a bottle of tea at me.

“They did have it,” he accuses, shaking his gallon of sweet tea at me. He gives me a glare and then walks out, leaving my coworker and I stunned. 

It was then time for me to take a break, so I headed out to my car, only to see the man and his sweet tea in the parking lot and get a dirty look. 

Only when I came back did I find out what had happened with the tea. It had been on a cart that was being taken out to stock the fridge shelves as I checked, so I didn’t see it. However, the man assumed I had lied to him, and therefore returned with his tea to yell at me.  

There are now signs on the back room doors that say “Back room team ONLY,” and I like to think that me telling my manager this story is the reason this happened.

,TalesFromRetail,"Okay. Our cast! M: manager, K: Karen, CF: my customer friend, OCs: other customers. Me: Me

This story starts on a Thursday night a couple weeks ago. I was on the late shift and one of our heavy lifter guys just got off work and came into the store with his mom to do some shopping.

He gets to my register and I’m ringing up his mom’s items when he tells me about this lady that was sitting in a chair we had up for auction, and that he told her she was not allowed.

I look behind him and say that there’s a lady sitting in the chair right now. He looks and exclaims that that’s the same lady!
So I finish checking them out and tell him that I’ll take care of it since he was off duty.
I stare at her for a few seconds before she makes eye contact and gets up to walk towards me. But another customer gets to my register first so I ring up his stuff.
Once I was done, I walk around the counter and towards the lady. And before I can say anything, she hands me money. (Intending to just pay for the purse she had grabbed off of one of our racks without ringing it up or anything)

Me: ma’am, you can’t just hand me money. You need to wait in line fo-

*cuts me off*
K: fine! Then I guess I’m not buying this!

She hands me the purse and walks off. I turn my back to her and put the purse behind the counter so I could put it back on the racks later. I turn back around towards her and she’s sitting in the chair again!
So I walk over towards her.

Me: ma’am, you can’t sit in this chair, it’s up for auction. But we have benc-

*she interrupts me by scoffing and standing up, grabbing her cart full of stuff, and walking out with it. I follow her.*

Me: ma’am, did you pay for that?

K: HOW DARE YOU?! INSINUATING THAT I WOULD STEAL! YOU HAVE SUCH A SMART ASS MOUTH! I CAN’T BELIEVE THEY WOULD HIRE SOMEONE LIKE YOU! 

she kept rambling on, screaming her head off, calling me a smart ass multiple times, among other things. She eventually demands to speak with the owner. I say I can call my manager.
I pull out my radio

Me: hey, M? Could you come up front? We have a *customer* with a *problem*

At this point, I was trying really hard to control my voice and nerves. This woman had me pissed off, but I wasn’t allowed to snap back at her, so my body was shaking with the rising pressure. 
My manager finally arrives and I just, point her in the direction of the customer.

The lady starts back up her tirade about how I have a smart ass mouth and should be fired and bla bla bla. My manager trying to cut in to speak.

M: ma’am, she is just doing her job.

K: she called me a thief! Do you believe her? I can’t believe this place has gone so far down hill! Hiring someone like that!

M: ma’am I’m going to have to ask you to leave

K: i can’t, I’m waiting on someone!

M: who?

K: that’s none of your business!

M: it is my business. It’s MY store!

At this point, the lady starts back up her tirade at my manager, and other customers are walking past us and looking at her, then at me. I guess they thought I was upset by what was happening, because I was shaking.

OC1: are you okay, dear?

Me: yeah

OC2: is she serious? She’s nuts!

OC1: yeah, she’s insane. She can’t be serious.

My manager turns away from the lady and tells me I can go back to my register. But as I’m walking away, I hear this little tid bit. The lady had turned to another customer and was trying to get them to agree with her on the situation.

K: you can’t think this is acceptable?

CF: lady, I’d rather be DEAD than talking with you.

Context for who CF is. He’s a regular customer who has made friends with all of those who work registers, and the managers. He’s the sweetest, most naive old man I have ever met. So it was both a shock, and a laugh riot to hear those words come out of his mouth.

Now I was shaking with laughter, and got a few more other customers asking if I was alright.

I later explained to my manager what happened before I called her up.

&lt;p&gt;The lady starts back up her tirade about how I have a smart ass mouth and should be fired and bla bla bla. My manager trying to cut in to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: ma’am, she is just doing her job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: she called me a thief! Do you believe her? I can’t believe this place has gone so far down hill! Hiring someone like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: ma’am I’m going to have to ask you to leave&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: i can’t, I’m waiting on someone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: that’s none of your business!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M: it is my business. It’s MY store!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the lady starts back up her tirade at my manager, and other customers are walking past us and looking at her, then at me. I guess they thought I was upset by what was happening, because I was shaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OC1: are you okay, dear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: yeah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OC2: is she serious? She’s nuts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OC1: yeah, she’s insane. She can’t be serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My manager turns away from the lady and tells me I can go back to my register. But as I’m walking away, I hear this little tid bit. The lady had turned to another customer and was trying to get them to agree with her on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K: you can’t think this is acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CF: lady, I’d rather be DEAD than talking with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context for who CF is. He’s a regular customer who has made friends with all of those who work registers, and the managers. He’s the sweetest, most naive old man I have ever met. So it was both a shock, and a laugh riot to hear those words come out of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was shaking with laughter, and got a few more other customers asking if I was alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I later explained to my manager what happened before I called her up. And she said, if someone gets that upset and offended over being asked that, it means they probably did steal something.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"One afternoon over the summer I was working up on the registers at the clothing and home store I work at, as I usually do. There was rain in the forecast and when you looked outside you could tell it was coming soon. At one point, this lady comes up to my register and she was buying a relatively large item. The woman wasn't exactly the nicest person I have ever checked out but she certainly wasn't mean or anything like that. After we finish, she asks if I can help her load the item into her car, to which I agreed. She told me to wait up by the front doors and she would pull her car around.

So I go up to the doors with her item and now I can hear the thunder and the wind is starting to pick up; so the rain was going to be there momentarily. This lady flies up in her mini SUV and jumps out to open the trunk, so I come outside to put it inside for her. For context, i drive an older sedan and do not know much about SUVs or mini SUVs. When I got to the back of her car I realized the trunk was not big enough to hold this item and realized we were going to have to put the back seats down. With the rain almost there we were both eager to finish this, but there was a little issue; the woman didn't know how to put the back seats down in her own car.

She looks at me and yells ""HOW DO I GET MY SEATS DOWN?"" I was a little stunned by that and said ""What?"" She then yelled again ""I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THESE DOWN, HOW DO I DO IT?"" At that point I was a little annoyed and perplexed and said ""Ma'am I don't know how these seats work, I don't drive this kind of car."" She then was getting worried and said ""WELL LOOK FOR SOMETHING!"" I start looking in her trunk and feeling the backs of the seats and I found one of those strap that was attached to the back and pulled it, and that did the trick. The lady was completely surprised and yelled ""HOW DID YOU DO THAT?"" and I showed her where the strap was. I loaded her item in the back and no sooner had I closed the trunk of her car did it start downpouring, and she ran inside her car and I ran inside.

,TalesFromRetail,"I have plenty of horrible stories from working over toys and electronics at a large retail chain. I thought this subreddit would like this story.  (Names changed for obvious reasons)

Me = Me

CTM = Clueless Training Manager

FG = Frantic Granny

So I apparently have some kind of deathwish, because I started working there the last week of October.  It was a frenzy and I was put in charge of the Toys and Electronics sections, the two busiest sections for this time of year.

Fast-Forward to Christmas Eve

By this time I was pretty comfortable in my role and closing the store.  I was working with CTN for my training, he was about my age (30s) but pretty out of touch with anything not dealing with Hunting/Sports.

We are getting ready to close the store and I hear wailing...not screaming, but it sounds like someone's world is ending.

I round the corner and there is a woman losing her mind and poor CTN just looks helpless.   I get the mental ""HELP ME"" scream so I come up and ask

Me : ""Is there something I can assist with today?""

FG: ""I'M THE WORST GRANDMOTHER EVER. I FORGOT WHAT KIND OF TOY IM SUPPOSED TO GET MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND THEY ARE ON A PLANE, I CANT CALL AND ASK""

Me: ""Oh no! Can you try to describe it to me?""

FG: ""Its the one with the pictures""

Me: ""That doesn't really narrow it down much, can you remember anything else?""

FG: ""It says the pictures!""

Now, While I am in my thirties, I don't have children, but I can vaguely form a picture of what she is talking about.  I can't quite name it yet, but I definitely recall it from my days of being a youth-assistant in my childrens church growing up. (I am a heathen now)

CTM: ""I can walk you over to our infant section and we can look there and see...""

FG: cuts him off ""I already looked there, I didn't see it.  They are going to ban me from being grandma if I don't get this toy""

I highly doubted this, but CTM asked her to humor him and they walked back over to the infant section.  I had a hunch out of nowhere and walked to our tucked away ""Retro Toys"" section, and there it was staring me in the face.  The ""See-And-Say"" in all its glory.  I could barely hide my smile as I had it behind my back and tracked them down in infant.

FG: ""It isn't here, it isn't here"" over and over.

Me: ""Ma'am, is this the toy you were looking for?""

She sees it and instinctively leaps at me giving me a surprisingly powerful hug.

FG: ""That's it! That's the toy! Oh thank you thank you, both of you thank you so much!"" tears of joy were streaming down her face as she continued to hug both of us.  After a few more seconds of gratitude, she puts the toy in her cart, and says in the coolest cool granny way possible ""Granny of the year, thanks to you boys!""

I work in a construction store and we have a paint department. Process is pretty simple, pick a swatch with the color you want, hand it to the paint person, and they mix the paint for you. I had a lady who didn’t seem to understand this concept when she came up to the register.

I was ringing her out and she had two cans of red paint. Just as I was about to ring them she stopped me.

Lady: Are those red?

Me: Yes!

Lady: I don’t want them. 

Me: Okay...????

Lady: Why did they give me red?

Me: -noticed swatch- Is this yours?

Lady: Yes.

Me: Did you pick this out and hand it to the paint people?

Lady: Yes.

Me: Did you ask them to mix it for you?

Lady: Yes.

Me: That’s why they gave you red. 

Lady: But I don’t want red! I want white!!

After some more back and forth I conceded and set the paint aside. I started trying to call up to the front to have someone bring her up some white paint (all the paint before it’s unmixed is white) figuring maybe the paint had been mixed by accident??? At this point the lady changed her mind again.

Lady: I want beige.

Me: Beige? Not white?

Lady: I want beige, not white. 

Me: You’ll have to go back to the paint department and pick out another color then.

Lady: Why can’t they bring it up here?

Me: Because there’s different shades and they’re not going to keep mixing paint if the color is off. That’s why they let you choose in the back.

More back and forth of this same nature with even a customer stepping in to explain to the woman how swatches work. Eventually my supervisor stepped in having overheard what was going on.

Supervisor: Ma’am, you need to go back to the paint department and pick out your color.

Lady: But I just want beige!

Supervisor: We can’t help you over here. My cashiers have other customers waiting to be helped and I’m not sending them back and forth to get you paint. Now you can either purchase the paint you already had mixed or go back there and figure out what color you want.

The lady made a bit more of a fuss before eventually my supervisor herded away. I learned later she had the same confusing back and forth conversation with one of the paint people who eventually refused to mix any colors until she either paid for the paint she’d picked out and requested earlier or settled on a color.

K: Ahem! she waits a few seconds and again but louder... Ahem! getting both of our attention.

Me: Yes, Can we help you?

K: Firstly, why is this fish cheaper than the other one (My colleague works on the fish counter)

C: Because they are two different species of fish, higher demand results in a higher price.

K: \*Scoffs\* Well I don't care about the fish anyway, Look at this plant, it's dead!

Me: I'm sorry, but the plant is perfectly fine, yes it may look a little bit wilted but that's because we haven't had the change to water them today and the ligh-

K: I don't care how busy you have been today, it only takes you a few seconds to put water in the plant, you butthole, how hard it that for you to do!

C: \*Stood there dumbfounded\* Look if you don't like the one you have, go put it back and choose another that isn't as wilted.

K: But I want this one! Can't you like take some money off of it or something?! (The plant costs £3...)

Me: No, I can't do that, like my colleague said you can go and choos-

K: Get me your manager! And while you're at it I want the number for head office

Me: Ok

I go to get my manager, but since rona, my manager has been shielding so I had to get another departments manager to come and assist.

M: How can I help you today?

K then goes on to explain how much of an A-hole I am for not watering a plant and refusing to take money off of the price of the plant

M: I'm sorry to hear that, but as GrumpyPingu said, he is unable to take money off of the price of the plant but if you would like you can put that one back and...

K: I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ONE!

K then shoved the plant back into her trolly (shopping cart), scoffed and stormed off, presumably to go and complain to head office about how her plant wasn't discounted.

Thinking about it now, I should have taken the plant off of her, walked to the faucet behind me and just filled the plant completely with water and handed it back to her, that would have been funny!

So round about 7 years ago I am working the Saturday opening shift at a large electronics retailer in the TV department. We open at 9 but being a weekend people start gathering at 8:45 like that will somehow get them a better deal.

Characters: Me, Customer (C), Supervisor (S), General Manager (GM)

The doors open and 20 or so people rush in and spread out like BBs from a claymore. 4 of them come straight for my department. The first asked where this simple accessory was, I show them , ask if they need help, no and thank you. A good start to a 10 hour shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I see C. I approach with my best CS smile and ...

Me: Good morning sir, can I help you with anything?

C: (Angrily) It's about god dam time, I've been waiting for 35 minutes.

Me: Sorry that's not possible, now can I help you with anything?

C: (With a look of apoplectic rage) Are you calling me a lire? 

Me: No sir, just stating that it is impossible for you to have been waiting that long since we have only been open for (check my watch) 4 minutes.

C: Get me your **f%&amp;\*ing** manager.

Me: (still smiling) Yes sir.

At this point I turn to go and get my supervisor. I should mention that I was having a hard time in my personal life and while I was unfailingly polite I was in no mood to take shit from someone that was either in a bad mood or angling for a discount. I got S and explained what had happened as we walked back to C.

S: What seems to be the problem?

C: This SOB (pointing at me) called me a lire.

Me: No I didn't. (still with the CS smile)

At this point C called me a few names that I don't like repeating even on the internet, and was starting to yell. S tried to calm him down but this only seemed to enrage him more. This attracted the attention of GM.

GM: What's going on here?

C: This assh\*&amp;\^ (pointing at me) called me a lire and this bi@#! (pointing at S) is being a condescending c\^&amp;t.

Cue about 10 minutes of GM getting the story of what happened, and something from C that resembled an epic poem of lies, betrayals, and oppression. I don't remember exactly what happened but somewhere in there C demanded that S and I both be fired and that if he didn't get one hell of a discount on a 60"" he would be suing. The one flaw in C's story was  that he told the truth that he claimed to be waiting for 35 minutes in the department. When C said that GM looked at his watch and we had only been opened for about 15 minutes. Given that C was getting more animated and louder as he spoke and was getting more belligerent towards all of us GM asked him to leave. At this point C told us all to go make love to ourselves and stormed out screaming that he would never come in here again.

I got to take a double long break 2 hours later.

Me: good morning! Oh, I see you have a return!

W: This pudding is dated from 2019.

Me: Oh no, let me take care of that. (Begins scanning the pudding for her refund, as it's dripping disgusting liquid all over and I am trying to keep it in the bag)

W: I didn't KNOW you sold stuff so OLD.

Me: well obviously it was a mistake that it was on the shelf.

W: I just don't know why you'd have something so OLD out for sale.

I ignored her and finished her refund, with a smile and a ""have a great day!! :) :)""

They did a service shift that required everyone with their service to get a small cable box in order to use the service. There was an option to have one delivered, or you could come into the store and get one. Many, many ppl chose to come to the very tiny store. We’re talking thousands of ppl. Not all in the same day obviously but enough to where I was hired for the sole purpose of opening the doors for customers and taking their name and issue down on a clipboard so they stayed in order of who came into the store first. 

At any time, we had 4-5 ppl assisting these customers with upgrades, getting boxes, etc. except on the weekend where there would be 2-3. I’m not in charge of scheduling 🤷‍♀️. So it’s a weekend and there are MAYBE 2 or 3 customers waiting to be served, and two being served currently when a red headed woman and her 3 year old stalk in past me - I’m holding the door with a huge smile and friendly “Good morning!” that she completely ignores and tries to go up to a coworker of mine who is clearly already assisting another customer.

He points at me and tells her she needs to get her name on the list and wait. She looks at me and goes into RAGE MODE. She starts screaming at me, “Why aren’t you behind a computer helping anyone?!!” I reply, “I’m sorry ma’am, I am the greeter, but I can take your name down, it looks like a ten minute wait!” And she rolls her eyes and throws her kid on her hip, walking over to me to get in my face, she spits through clenched teeth, “All you do is GREET PEOPLE?! YOUR JOB IS POINTLESS AND YOURE A WASTE OF SPACE!! IF I WAS YOUR BOSS, YOU’D BE FIREEEEDDD!!!” 

I held the door open and my tears back as I smiled and said “I’m so sorry, I hope you have a great day!”. She glared and flew past me, cussing me out all the way to her car.

I immediately went to the break room and cried haha. I know in that moment, my job did look pointless, but I was doing what I was hired to do - I wanted to be on a computer helping like the rest of them but I literally had no training or even a computer logon to do anything!

,TalesFromRetail,"Hello, so I live in Norway and work at a kiosk.

We have a general term here that's called ""tipping"". Directly translated it means betting, but to clarify what that exactly means: everything from scratch cards, to lotteries, to eurojackpots to other types of betting. Now we have these game machines in a section of the kiosk where a lot of older folks meet and hang out. Think slot machines, but a lot of other games like blackjack and poker too.  
  
Most of our customers are very nice in general, but these guys are on another level. 
These guys usually come in around 6 PM and stay until 10ish, we close at 11. 
We have a barstool like 3-4 meters away from the counter where us employees can sit down, and when one of these guys come in they always say ""you don't have to get up, son"" because I'd usually only sit if there wasn't any customers in the store.  
When I'm mopping the floors around 9 PM they always stand up, pick up the barstool they were sat on, and step aside so I can mop in front of the machines.  

When I first started working here I was very uncomfortable with the terminal we sell all of the different lotteries from, because there are a lot of options and buttons, but these guys were always super nice and patient with me, even guiding me through some parts where my training lacked.

,TalesFromRetail,"Last night (2/4) was a bad night in general.  There were barely any nice customers and every one was just really rude. I was near tears all night long but this one Jerk and his Jerk Son took the night away. 

I apologize for confusing writing, I'm still pissed about it. 

There were three other employees working that I'll just refer to as A, B, and C. 

A went on break so I was up at the registers to cover her. I was just trying to catch my breath for a bit before these three customers came up to the candy (which is right by the registers). They were going over all the tables talking about the really low prices and how astounding they were - which is common. The Jerk and his Jerk Son weren't wearing masks, but the Wife was wearing a mask, albeit wrong (under the nose). 

It was just normal customer talk until Jerk brought up that he had found a water bottle sitting in a cart. I perked up and was listening because my water bottle was sitting in my cart out on the floor. I hadn't opened it yet because I simply didn't have the time.  Jerk then says that he opened it up and SPIT in it. I was furious and disgusted. I checked with my fellow coworkers to make sure they didn't have a bottle of water sitting in their cart. They didn't, so it had to be mine. 

While checking them out, Wife picked up a face shield and sat it down to buy, Jerk and Jerk Son started making fun of her for it. Wife said, ""You won't be laughing when you get COVID."" to which Jerk replied ""Everyone's going to get COVID, I'll see to that."" which makes them spitting in someone else's water all the more horrible. 

After A came back from break, I told her and B what had happened and went to check my water bottle. Sure enough, the seal was broken and it was cloudy. They spit in my freaking water. I didn't even get one sip out of it. 

I went and found C to tell him what had happened, and he asked me who it was. I described the people who did it, and of course they did something to him, too. 

In Carpets, Jerk looked C dead in the eyes with a smile, walked past him and let out a disgusting smelly fart. Literally, purposefully crop dusted poor C. 

Someone had also ripped open a bag of candy and stuck a plunger to the floor, and even though we can't prove it was them, we're still pretty sure the jerks did it based off these two incidents.

Edit: thanks for the support and concern everyone! I just want to acknowledge your concerns and questions. This happened last night and I wasn't really thinking much about bio terrorism. It was a crap night in general and this guy just made it much worse. I tossed the bottle in the trash, so I can't collect it and send it to the cops. As much as I hate people like this, getting into a legal dispute right now isn't what I need right now. 

I'll leave that decision to management, I told my manager on duty last night and im gonna tell my store gm today so he can pass on it to who needs to hear it and make all the decisions.

,TalesFromRetail,"A decade ago, back when I was fresh out of college and getting a Real Job, I started working at a big box store as a cashier. I grew up very conscious of waste and so I started out trying my best to give customers as much shopping bag as they needed and no more. We had tiny bags, normal bags, and giant bags.

One night a customer was buying just one or two normal-sized bottles of Gatorade, or they were the last two things of an order and everything else but not those fit in one normal bag. They were just about the perfect size for the tiny bag, so I started to put them in the tiny bag.

""Wait! I don't want that bag, I want the normal bag! Those heavy bottles will go right through the plastic!""

Now, this was my first retail job, and I guess I still thought I was a normal human being when wearing the uniform, and I knew those bags had pretty much the same strength because they had the same construction, just a different size. I was confident that the tiny bag would hold those bottles fine, so I said, a little confused, but prodding, ""But it's the same plastic?""

I don't remember how what she said next started, but it ended with ""we could cancel my order and I'll take my business elsewhere. Or maybe we should get a manager?""

Here's your normal bag ma'am. This is your total. Thank you, goodnight.

She went straight to the customer service desk to complain about me anyway. The shift manager and the desk clerk came to me after she'd talked to them and left in a huff. Apparently they were both baffled by her story and needed me to even clarify what she wanted. One of them said, ""But... it *is* the same plastic?""

And that's the story of how I died a little for the first time.

Edit: Okay, based on what I saw before I turned off comment notifications, I deleted the speculation on if retail is a Real Job. I meant it to be self-deprecating. I still work in retail.

NOT a woman refusing to wear a mask story!

A few months ago, around end of November, beginning of December, a woman came into the girls clothing store I worked at. Now the store I worked at recently closed due to being bought out. A lot of people were mad about that, yelling at the employees and demanding explanation. I wasn’t a manager or anything, so I didn’t really know much, just what I was told. So all I knew was that any purchases made after November 12th were final sale, no returns or exchanges. The registers are also set up where we have signs saying all sales are final and we have plexiglass between the cashier and customer. 

This lady came into the store and she looked pretty put together and wealthy. She was wearing form fitting jeans, a sweater, and had nice makeup on. In my area we require masks or face shields, so she had a face shield on(it comes into play later). She also had 2 girls with her, probably 9 and 5. Both of the girls were also nicely dressed.

She walked around for a bit before finally choosing a set of PJs. She walked up to my register and paid for her things, with me telling her 2 times verbally that all sales were final. We tell them all sales are final before they pay and again when we mark their receipt final sale. She acknowledged me, paid, and went to walk out of the store. On her way out she stopped and looked at the PJs again. She seemed to find another set she liked, so she walked back up to the register. 

I took her at my register, assuming she wanted to buy the other set, but she slammed the bag of purchased PJs and the other set on the counter and said “I want to exchange these.” I looked at her and said, “I’m sorry ma’am, but all sales are final so I’m unable to do that.” She didn’t like that answer and started saying “I didn’t even leave the store, I was just bought these, do it.” I explained to her again that I’m unable to do that, we didn’t even have the option on the register anymore. She got more and more visibly aggravated with me. 

She kept demanding that I exchange the items, using so many different excuses like “I just bought them, they are the same price, I didn’t even leave, you didn’t tell me it’s final sale, etc.” Keep in mind, there are signs all over the store saying final sale AND I told her 2 times. I kept telling her over and over that I couldn’t exchange them, but would be happy to ring it up in a separate purchase for her. She wasn’t having it. She eventually slid her face shield up and spit in my direction. The spit landed on the plexiglass and not on me, but at that point I wasn’t taking it anymore. 

I’m not sure if she knew the plexiglass was there or not, but either way I was done. I called my manager over and calmly explained the situation to her before stepping back. Now, my manager is very mama-bear type. If someone messes with her employees she doesn’t take it. She took one look at the customer and said, “you have 5 seconds to leave the store or I’m calling security to come in here and drag you out.” 

The customer was taken aback for a bit, but eventually grabbed the PJs she purchased and stormed out. Her daughters just looked scared and embarrassed of their mom the whole time. 

The store closed shortly after that, so I’m not sure if anything ever came of it, but let’s just say I’m glad I don’t work retail anymore.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work at a grocery store. I’ve worked at 2 grocery stores in the past year. I’ve only had one particularly bad customer at my last job, but this one tonight was the worst ever. Also I’m a teenager. 

I’m a cashier and I was running self-check out tonight. A lady comes up to me and tells me that her 2 for $4 sale didn’t show up on the receipt. I ask her to hand me the item so I can check to see if the sale is in her system. It’s not and I inform her it’s not in the system and that I can go check for her. I ask her where she got it from and she seemed to get upset over that, so I just leave and walk up to my coworker to ask her. It’s right on the aisle, we check the sale and the expiration date, great the sale is there so we can go correct this for her. 

So my coworker (she’s trained in front desk) says she’ll handle it. She asks the customer if she’s already paid for it and says,”okay, there’s nothing more we can do. But we can take you to customer service to take it from there.” 

The customer lady turns to me and says,”Why’d you even try to help me? This was useless.” Which is it’s not because we got all the information she needs to get her refund. Our assistant manager is seeing this commotion and walks over and my coworker tells him she needs a refund. Okay, perfect, his problem now. 

So another customers walks up and tells me her sale didn’t show up either. At the same time, the previous lady comes up and accuses me of not giving her her receipt back. Now I have 2 upset customers, so I excuse myself and walk over to the desk to get help. 
I got so overwhelmed, and both the customers followed me. I manage to quickly tell another front desk person that this new customer needs help. The original lady starts complaining to my manager about the missing receipt that I stole and never gave back to her. I tell them I’ll go check for the receipt because I figured I set it down. 

She follows me again accusing me of stealing her receipt. I look for the receipt at the self-check out stand, I can’t find it. I turn to the cashier who checked her out and ask her if she can print her prior transaction. She can’t because she’s had other customers. My ASM comes back because this lady is yelling at me in front of everyone. I have to dig through the trash for her receipt to see if it’s there. It’s not anywhere. This woman just gets more heated and starts screaming at me more and accusing me. 

I know now that I handed her back her receipt because I remember I handed it back to her when I went to go check the sale. My ASM is trying to calm her down. I ask if it’s in her purse because I see a receipt in her purse and she got so offended that I asked and handed me her purse. My ASM is like “no we don’t need to do that.” And tries coaxing her to the customer service desk to stop yelling at me in the store basically.

All of a sudden her receipts in her hand &amp; she’s still yelling at me that I didn’t give it back to her. Where’d it magically come from then lady!? My ASM says we’ll get her her refund for  29 cents &amp; she corrects him and goes “no 39 cents plus tax!” 

She got her fucking 39 cents refund while bitching about me to my manager and how I’m incompetent. She finally leaves and then harasses my coworker from earlier about where to leave her cart. Everyone tries to console me and say it happens to everyone. My mom said I need to stop being such a pushover and verbal punching back. Others say I should’ve been more confrontational because I just stood there and took it. 

It costs nothing to be kind, but it also costs 39 cents to be a raging cunt. 

tldr; customers sale didn’t ring up correctly in receipt, I check sale, we inform her that customer service can issue her refund. She calls me useless for going to check the sale.

I'm working, as an assistant manager, in a shop in the weeks following Christmas one year. We have a display of boxed chocolates and other sweet gifts. There's an older lady perusing this selection as I'm tidying shelves, checking stock levels etc, when I hear a loud, very posh voice.

""Excuse me, you there!""

""Can I help Madame?""

""Yes, I'm looking for a box of chocolates.""

""Anything in particular?""

""Well, just something to replace these.""

She had with her, in her hand, a box of chocolates that we sold, that much I could see. I mentioned that I'd be happy to help her find a replacement. I knew these weren't exclusive to us and could be found elsewhere locally, so I asked if she had her receipt.

""Oh no,"" she replied haughtily ""I didn't BUY them, they were a gift! My grandchildren told me THEY bought them here.""

""Oh okay, that shouldn't be a problem."" Were a small town, and I would normally recognise the customer, but we have a few well off, older people that rarely visit the local shops and I thought I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, she was a bit superior but I was determined to be professional and polite.

""May I just ask, what's the problem with the chocolates you are returning?"" I asked

""Oh there's nothing WRONG with them, I just don't like them!"" 

It was at this point I became a little suspicious.

""I'm sorry, could I just see which ones they are?"" I said

It was at this point, when she held the box out, I could see that they had been opened, the seal broken and the inner packaging loose.

""I'm sorry Madame"" I told her ""this box has been opened, I can't accept a return if the product isn't faulty ""

""Well of COURSE it's open, I had to try them, that's how I know I don't like them.""

""But there's nothing actually wrong with them? They're not mouldy or contaminated?""

""No, I just don't LIKE them!"" Her condescending tone was starting to get to me.

""I'm sorry Madame, I won't be able to accept these for return as the product was in good condition when we sold them and they've been opened since.""

""This is ATROCIOUS, how am I supposed to know if I like something if I can't open it!? I will NOT be shopping here again!"" with that she stormed out.

This might have carried some weight if she had actually ever deigned to shop here in the first place.

At my town, a national gas station franchise is partnered with my store so our rewards system works with their store and their cards/coupons will work with our store depending on the situation. This is important to know for the situation that happened yesterday.

  A elderly guest with a golf hat, I'll call him Golf Hat Man (GHM) from here on out, came up to the gas station, ready to be checked out. He handed out his card, a holographic green-white card that I would usually have to use a different card reader on and then house charge it.

   GHM: ""You know how to do this right""

   Me: ""Of course""

  So as I've said, I would have to use a card reader on my end that would take an amount out of the card and then I would have to house charge it from our system. I swiped the card, entered the amount and proceeded with the transaction. Card Declined, that rarely happens to me, so there must be something wrong with the system I assumed; I called one of my managers to come up and I told GHE that his card was declined.

  GHE: ""You said you knew how to work this.""

  I responded telling him that I did know and I am have a manager coming down to support. I believe I also told him again that his card was still declining on my card reader.

  GHE: ""Well it seems that you store is false advertising. Clearly it would work at [National Gas Station].""

  I was a bit confused at what he meant by that but it was obvious to me and my coworkers around that he was getting agitated. It was the worst of times for this to happen as well since a line of people was forming right behind him. He was talking about how he got this card and how it would work every time here and other places; around this time my manager came down wondering what was going on as well. She asked if his card was expired to which he looked around asking himself if it was expired.

  GHE: ""Look it doesn't say that it is expired at all."" 

  There wasn't a expiration date on there, don't think there are expiration dates on those cards so I couldn't blame him there. The situation wasn't getting nowhere, so he went and threw a hundred on the counter ( A ripped one at that). Saying that we should get a supervisor being okay that he will go and get his gas somewhere else from now on; can't remember what my manager said but I said yes with no hesitation (He was getting me agitated at that moment, and while I wasn't cussing him out, thankfully, I was acting a bit of a smart-ass.). I remember the he said to me before he left.

  GHE: ""At least I know you name for next time Mr. Know-it-All [My Name]"" 

  At that moment I decided, by my own principals, to not have my nametag out for the public. I know I'll get in trouble from my managers for that but I'd rather not have another upset guest know about me more than I would want to have. My manager who was there apologized to me for having to take the blunt of GHE, I told her not to worry about it. 

  Apologizes for what I think was a post that went a bit all over the place at the end. Usually I don't like to talk about stuff like this that happens in my life, it makes me feel like I'm complaining.

Some details to preface this: I work in a local convenience store. We sell snacks, tacos and chicken (delicious), and gas (not diesel, hence the title. Although we have the button and spot for diesel on the pump, we don’t actually have it). Also the large majority of our customers are regulars.

Cast:
Me: me obvi
CW: co worker
DG: Diesel Guy

It was about 6pm-ish and I still had to wait until midnight to go home. It was pretty slow that day, and my CW was going to leave in two hours to leave me by my lonesome except for the stocker, who’d be around the store

So as I said, it’s slow, nothing to do, when in comes a guy I had never seen before. We get a lot of regulars but it’s not uncommon to see passerby and what not. He wasn’t wearing a mask but had a cloth over his face. His shirt was dirty and had what seemed to be oil stains. It looked as if he had just been working on a car or something. We get a lot of blue collar workers who come here, so it’s not uncommon to see people looking like that. 

Anyway, he walks up to the counter and pulls 4 $1 bills out of his back pocket and places it on the counter. He says nothing and just stares at me. So I wait a moment to see if he says anything. 

Silent 

Me: Um sir, what is this for

DG: ...

Me: Sir?

DG: *grunts*

Me: Is this for gas?

DG: ...

Me: Para gasolina? 

Note: (Many Spanish speakers in this are so I thought maybe he didn’t understand my English)

DG: *vaguely points at gas pumps*

Ok we’re getting somewhere now

Me: Ok, which pump sir?

DG: *silent*

Me: dónde?

DG: *holds up two fingers and grunts*

Me: Ok so $4 in pump 2? (Just trying to make sure)

DG: ...

Me: cuatro en dos?

DG: *grunts and leaves*

Me: *shrugs and puts the money on pump 2*

After that I turn to my coworker and ask him what the hell that was and laughed. He said he didn’t know laughed as well

So, I can see on the screen of register that he’s pumping gas, so I assume that’s the end of it. It wasn’t. 

This next part is where two things happen

1. You find out why he’s called DG
2. He speaks! English at that!

He comes back in a moment later, half in the store, half out. He looks at me the following exchange happens. 

DG: Hey do you guys have diesel 

Me: No sir we don’t

DG: ...Can you put diesel?

Me: We don’t have diesel 

DG: But can you put diesel?

Me: Sir we don’t have it

DG: Ok but can you put some?

Me: We don’t have it sir. We don’t carry it

DG: Can you put diesel?

Me: We physically do not have it sir. I can’t give you what we don’t have

DG: ...But can you put some?

At this point I was so frustrated and just ducked behind the counter and my coworker said he’d deal with it. 

He walks outside with the guy to figure out what happened. CW came back and told me that he had a hard time asking him questions because DG said mostly nothing, even if CW asked him in English or Spanish. Turns out the guy had already pumped the gas he needed (his car didn’t even take diesel) and that was that. 

Or so I thought. 

At this point, I don’t remember if I was I break or in the bathroom, but the point is, I wasn’t in the room when this next part happened. So to save time explaining, CW and DG had a similar conversation in which DG tells CW he thinks he pumped diesel and fucked up his car. CW tells him that he couldn’t have messed up his car with diesel because we don’t carry it. This exchange goes on for a while before DG says “you don’t have diesel?”

CW: No

DG: Ok *walks out*

Apparently when they were outside DG said the same thing, realized we didn’t have diesel. 

To make a long story a little longer, DG was still in the parking lot with his hood open, messing with the engine. Turns out his car wasn’t working because it was over heated. He came in again and CW asked if he needed help with his car and basically had to play charades again to understand that the guy needed a gallon of water to cool of the engine. When CW finally asked if that’s what he needed, DG just walked out the door. CW got him some water, and the engine was cooled off, and DG left. 

The rest of the night was slow, but that moment made it interesting enough to not care as much.

,TalesFromRetail,"So a while ago I was working in a big chain store for pet supplies.  
A part of our stock was seasonal products, many of them for wild birds.

I was working the register on an average day, engaging the the occasional conversation with the customers, when an old lady comes to the register.  
I ring her up and tell her the total, and she pays with nothing out of order happening.  
She leaves, but comes back about 2 minutes later.  
I ask her if there was a problem, thinking maybe I had accidentally rung something twice or given her the wrong change, despite always being very careful.

In the following exchange, L is the Lady, M is the manager

Me: ""Is there something else that you need?""  
L:     ""Well, you have typed in the wrong price.""  
Me: ""Wrong price? Our prices are in the system, but I will have a look.""  
L:     ""See, this bird house is 19.99.""  
Me: ""Yes, that's the right price.""

The ladys features darkened instantly.

L:     ""No, you typed it wring. The price tag says it's 0.99.""  
Me: "" Oh, I don't think that's right. Can you show me the tag?""  
L:     ""Are you saying I am a liar?"" This is a scam! You are trying to rob me!""  
Me: ""No, not at all. But maybe you looked at the wrong tag? A birdhouse can't be 0.99. Can you please   
show me where you got it?""  
L:    ""This is fraud. You can't do this to me!""  
Me:  ""Please calm down, I will look at the tag.""  
M:   ""Hello, is there a problem?""  
L:    ""This boy is trying to rob me!""  
Me: ""The lady says the price tag for this says 0.99. I asked her to show it to me.""  
M:    \*confused look\* ""Alright, let's have a look then.""

The lady now finally shows us where she got the item.  
It was a big basket, with several items displayed next to each other and the pricetags for each one in the front.

L:    ""See! It says 0.99!"" \*pointing to the small treats RIGHT NEXT to a bunch of similar birdhouses\*  
Me: ""No, this is for the treats. I'm sorry for the confusion, mam, but it is clearly labled.

The tags had the product names on them.

L:    ""No, it was not laying with these! It was on top of these snacks, so this tag is the valid one!""  
M:   ""Well, some customer may have put it down there because it's easier than to fit it back in. But this   
is clearly not the correct tag. A birdhouse can not-""  
L:    ""I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I WILL CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW!""  
M:    ""Of course we can take the house back, but we can't sell it for 0.99.""

She went on screaming and the manager gestured me to go back inside.  
A few moments later they went inside, and the lady smugly held out the item.  
I did the return, gave her back her money and suppressed the urge to roll my eyes.

L:   ""That will teach you. And I will NEVER come to this store again.""

She said in a victorious tone.

I couldn't help but grin widely at that.

Me: ""Oh I see! Have a great rest of your life then!""

She points to her ugly loafers shes buying.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work in online shopping at a major grocery store. A crazy lady with no mask came to our collections desk to collect an order, things were going ok until I hand her the receipt. The way our online shopping works is an online shopper picks up the order and checks it out at around 2pm, while customers collect at 4-8pm. Collections area is like a drive-thru. Receipts very clearly show what is not available, and we even substitute items sometimes. CL is Crazy Lady. BD is her equally Batty Daughter.

CL: Where's my (very specific cat food)?

Me: Apologies ma'am, but your car food was not available today.

CL: It's in the store now! Can't you just go and get it for me? (Collections area is actually separate to the store and I work alone so not way to verify this without leaving everything unattended)

Me: Sorry ma'am, but it must have been delivered to the store past our collection time of 2pm. 

(Shopping is already paid by card when customers collect and I have no POS so couldn't even ring it up and add it on if I wanted to.)

CL: THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

BD: WE'VE BEEN CHARGED FOR SOMETHING WE DIDN'T EVEN RECIEVE!!! WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER???

Me: Ma'am, it says very clearly on the website that there is no guarantee of item availability, especially during the pandemic. You also have not been charged for the unavailable cat food. (this is true, banner at checkout screen and also longer explanation on the info page)

BD: But the total is €128!!!! How is that so high? 

Me: You bought 8 cases of Red Bull at €8 each for a total of €64, and 8 bottles of wine at €8 each for a total of €64. If you add €64 and €64 together, the total is €128.

(At this point I could see the gears slowly turning in their heads, but they doubled down. I went into my ""corporate robot that takes no flak from annoying customers"" mode).

CL: Why couldn't someone call us to tell us the items weren't available?

Me: This is not done at our store (or even in the company for that matter)

CL: Why can't you help us pack our items into the car?! 

* CL feigns being unable to lift the cases of Red Bull into her car and pouts*

Me: I cannot touch your shopping due to store policy and the coronavirus pandemic. Also, social distancing rules and both of you not wearing masks renders me unable to do so. (I help if customers are nice about it, especially my regulars and I sanitise before and after, but I'm really not supposed to. No way was I bending the rules for this delightful duo though.)


BD: Why are there no bags with the order? 

Me: This is not done at our store, and it also says this very clearly on the website that bags will not be provided unless specifically ordered and paid for due to the plastic bag levy. 

BD: Where's your manager?! 

Me: Ma'am, my manager is gone home now but you're very welcome to lodge a complaint with the manager on duty in-store. (this is true and is actually policy. We don't call managers unless it's a problem related to a sale at POS, which is most of the time but doesn't apply to me and I've been told as much before. I'm never supposed to leave my post unattended due to the risk of robbery.) 

CL: (competitor store) offers bags AND helps us pack! We're going to shop there instead!

(I know for a fact they don't even have an online shopping department).

Me: Ok. 

*CL and BD see I'm unfazed*

BD: We're calling the customer service hotline!

Me: Ok. 

*They see I am still unfazed, and leave in a huff.*

I shortened the story for brevity, but I spent about 10 mins because it was quiet explaining how if an item is not available at 2pm but is delivered to the store later than 2pm, it is not physically possible to pick up that item for an online shopping order.

I&amp;#39;m never supposed to leave my post unattended due to the risk of robbery.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CL: (competitor store) offers bags AND helps us pack! We&amp;#39;re going to shop there instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I know for a fact they don&amp;#39;t even have an online shopping department).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CL and BD see I&amp;#39;m unfazed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BD: We&amp;#39;re calling the customer service hotline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They see I am still unfazed, and leave in a huff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shortened the story for brevity, but I spent about 10 mins because it was quiet explaining how if an item is not available at 2pm but is delivered to the store later than 2pm, it is not physically possible to pick up that item for an online shopping order. I also spent longer explaining difficult mathematical equations such as how €64 + €64 = €128. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost all faith in humanity long ago, but it is actually scary that people like this are allowed to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

The store I work at has decided to capitalize on this by expanding the types of papers and wraps we sell, including cones. 

Cones are just preformed papers shaped well kinda like a cone, the narrow end contains a filter (though much different from a cigarette filter) and the wide end is open for filling.

The only brand we carry are Zigzag cones which come in a black and orange box, although a box of cones is as tall as a pack of the 100's size cigarette boxes they are only half the width (only 6 cones in a box) and there's a picture of an empty cone on the front of the box.

I turn and point to the orange pall malls and ask ""you mean these?""

So I really didn't think they could actually be mistaken for a box of cigarettes but ask anyway if she means those bc I'm out of other orange options and lo and behold that's exactly what she meant.

A customer finally snapped and full-on **S.C.R.E.A.M.E.D.** at another customer who got too close to them today.

Our store is relatively large but we keep capacity pretty low overall because people get jammed up in smaller sections of the store. Candles is a great example of a place in my store that gets jammed up quite a bit because everyone loves fucking candles. it's tucked away in a corner, there's a couple rows, there's a weird display shelf just chilling in the middle. Anyways, I was in the back corner, making my rounds, checking in on guests, encouraging guests to (safely) smell the candles and answering questions. 

I'm checking in on a guest and going over features of a couple different candles. I can see a guest is trying to get my attention and I move out of the one guests way (that I was just helping) and I can see the other guest that flagged me down is distancing themselves from everyone. I strike up a conversation from a distance and I make my way around to an area that's less crowded for them and for me, there was one person by our weird shortened display shelf and they're holding some candles. 

Now, I must have missed a first part of this altercation where the customer I was helping asked the one by the display shelf to keep their distance because what happened next seemed out of nowhere.

The customer holding candles by the display shelf must have changed their mind and they went to go around the customer I was helping. The customer I was helping started **screaming** and thrust out their arm with their hand up.

Cs; ""**STOP! YOU'RE TOO CLOSE. YOU NEED TO BACK UP.""**

Oc: ""I was here fi--

Cs: ""**I TOLD YOU BEFORE TO GET. AWAY. FROM. ME!**""

Me. **O.O** *To OC:* ""Can I have you just go around the other way for me right now?""

It was super awkward. But also in an effort not to continue to cause another screaming match and deescalate, I immediately put the screaming customer in what's basically an employee only area (It's normally an open part of our store but it's closed off for ""staging"" right now) so they could continue to shop at their comfort level with the candles. It was awkward a little bit but they were super appreciative and receptive to everything I had to say about the candles and even smelled a couple. Someone came by and was like, ""What's with the customer and all the candles in the staging area?"" so I explained what happened and said it was a de-escalation technique but also I didn't want them screaming at anyone else that dared get too close.

Later the customer who got screamed at came up to me and was upset. I did apologize and tell them I understood, I would have been too, but it's incidents exactly like that we're trying to avoid by limiting our capacity size and asking customers to social distance and right now it's up to everyone to do their best to follow those requests as best as they can.

Now in my store we have a no return policy on intimates (underwear and bras) and it is displayed by signs on all the bra and panty racks and at the front desk . We also remind the customers that are buying as gifts of the no return policy and point to the sign at the desk. We can be a little relaxed on the bras if they still have all the tags on them and look like they were bought yesterday, but it's an absolute no on panties. 

This lady had 7 pairs of panties and 3 bras she wanted to  return. No tags. Way past the 30 day return policy. And she had just admitted they had been worn.

I did the polite, ""I'm sorry ma'am but we have a no return policy on intimates and your receipt says its passed the 30day return date as well. By policy, I can't do anything.""

""Well these were a christmas gift and they didn't work out so I need to return them."" Que her starting to go Karen as she slams her large wallet onto the counter.

""I'm sorry ma'am, but it's against store policy for me to do a return on worn intimates that are also past the 30 day return date."" I am being as polite as I can here.

""you mean you won't give me my money back?"" She is exasperated and throws the panties in her hand onto the counter and they slide so far they almost fall off the other side.

I grimace at her and shrug in the ""I'm sorry there's nothing I can do"" expression.

""But you have to give me my money back. I can't use these. She didn't even wear them. Is there a manager I can talk to?"" She starts to get irate and shoves the bras at me next.

""Ma'am. I am a manager. There are no tags on these, they have been worn. You said your niece tried them on to find out they didn't fit. This is,"" I look at the date on the receipt, ""a month and a half past the 30 day return period.""

""But you have to-"" she starts to get loud, looking around for sympathy from other customers who are actually trying to avoid eye contact with her.

""If I make this return, I could lose my job due to the health code violation alone. So, no. I will not do this return. In fact, here is my store manager now. Hey boss lady? We don't do returns on worn intimates, right?!""

My store manager, best manager I have ever had the pleasure of working for, walks up to the desk after coming back from her lunch and stares this clearly angry Karen down. ""No. We don't. We even have signs everywhere saying we don't. And if you're going to argue with my assistant manager, you can kindly leave.""

""This is ridiculous! Do you guys see this?!"" the lady looks around to try to pull another customer into her side but everyone has literally decided to be interested in merchandise as far away from her as they can get. She throws a handful of the panties at me and huffs and grumbles and shouts, ""Really?!"" as she trudges out the door of our shop.

Later my darling store manager says, ""I would have given her corporate's number to complain too if she wanted. John loves any opportunity to talk shop and ask what really happened. You know I used to buy hay for my horses from him?""

,TalesFromRetail,"Tl/dr - Man tries to argue that lifetime warranty on tires is the span of a human lifetime.

This happened yesterday. I work in the automotive section of my local branch of large retailer. I am a sales clerk and ring people up for services they get in the garage and anything else they drag to my counter basically.

Yesterday a man comes in because his driver front tire was in need of replacing. He was an older gentleman that, of course, forgot his paperwork that shows he paid for our tire warranty. We can retrieve old orders so the techs do so and see that he did buy our warranty.

We have a certain warranty we offer for an additional charge if customers buy tires through us and have them installed in the garage.

It's a pretty sweet deal but it has limits. Our store will repair or replace the tires for one year after purchase if anything goes wrong. After a year the tires will be prorated based on tread depth. That means if your tires aren't bald and you bought them over a year ago, we knock some off the price of a new replacement.

After an hour his order comes through the printer and I call his name to complete the transaction. Once I scan the barcode it charges him full price and he wasn't having that. So I gather up the paperwork and head out to speak to the tech who worked on his car.

Turns out the man bought his set of tires in 2016.  That is almost five full years. Our warranty would cover his tires if he had parked the car and never used them, but this wasn't the case and his tires were bald from use.

I return to the counter to explain this. The man adamantly declares he bought the tires last year and they are under warranty. This is impossible but I go to the computer and pull up his records. He did come in for the same reason last September and have a prorated replacement of his passenger front. I show this to him but it's not good enough. He swears he bought a whole new set with the warranty. He also bought the lifetime warranty so that means he pays nothing.

At this point I'm done so I call my manager and explain everything to him. He recognizes the man and remembers that he did the same thing last September and somehow weaseled a prorated tire out of the other manager that works during the week. Probably to get him out of her face.

Well this manager wasn't having it. He takes a stack of papers over to the man and shows him where he bought the tires in 2016 and how last year he pulled this same trick and somehow managed a discount but now too much time has passed and he can't have any discounts based on a five year old warranty because his tires are bald. He even had the tech bring in his old tire to demonstrate how we measure tread depth and how his tire isn't making the cut.

What does he do? He claims that isn't his tire! That he never bought that brand and how we switched out his tire to rob him. The warranty said lifetime! 

My manager tiredly explain it's the lifetime of the tire, not a human lifetime. He also explained that tire years are based on tread depth and how his tires have now expired and are basically zombie tires from beyond the 6 ply grave.

This man was trying to claim he thought it meant *his* lifetime. I knew this was bogus because he was desperately trying to convince me that his last con was a purchase of four new tires with the warranty last year.

At this point the man is ranting that we're robbing him, but he will return with money to pay for the new tire. He does return a short while later and lectures me about how lifetime should be lifetime and how his tire was swapped. He will never shop here again and so forth.

&lt;p&gt;This happened yesterday. I work in the automotive section of my local branch of large retailer. I am a sales clerk and ring people up for services they get in the garage and anything else they drag to my counter basically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a man comes in because his driver front tire was in need of replacing. He was an older gentleman that, of course, forgot his paperwork that shows he paid for our tire warranty. We can retrieve old orders so the techs do so and see that he did buy our warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a certain warranty we offer for an additional charge if customers buy tires through us and have them installed in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a pretty sweet deal but it has limits. Our store will repair or replace the tires for one year after purchase if anything goes wrong. After a year the tires will be prorated based on tread depth. That means if your tires aren&amp;#39;t bald and you bought them over a year ago, we knock some off the price of a new replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen: &amp;quot;No you have to pay extra to be on during this show! I hate hearing your ads during the show. It is just wrong for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Well we choose what stations to put the ads on based upon demographics. The first being above average education and the second being disposable income.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen: &amp;quot;Those people aren&amp;#39;t smart! I know I listen every day.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Do you shop here regularly?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen: &amp;quot;Yes at least once a week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;And you hear our advertisements during the show&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen: &amp;quot;Yes! EVERYDAY.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me partially stumped: &amp;quot;So, The advertisements are hitting our demographic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen slightly flummoxed: &amp;quot;But I don&amp;#39;t want you advertising on that station.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Why do you listen to the show?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karen&amp;#39;s eyes narrow and she almost growls: &amp;quot;So I know what the enemy is up to.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just said okay and she eventually left. I did see her once at a big box store and she yelled at me for shopping at a place that treated their employees so poorly and I should shop at the store I worked at. All the while she had a cart full of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I once worked at a store that sold, but also bought and traded, arcade machines, pool tables and other ""man cave"" items. My job was repairing the machines, but this tale doesn't involve me repairing anything so it doesn't really fit in TFTS.

I notice the back exit has a free-standing dartboard blocking it. Rather than confront anybody about it for fear of starting an argument, I just move it out of the way, and I figured that would be the end of the story. 

WRONG. 
It's right back in the same spot in less than an hour. This time there's someone nearby. I don't say a word and I just move it, but he tells me ""people keep going out that door, but it doesn't always close all the way, and then the burglar alarm might trigger overnight"". I tell him ""we'll get a ticket from the fire marshal if an exit is blocked"" and then he replies ""the fire marshal comes in and has a fit, we'll just move it out of the way while he's here"". I don't bother saying anything else.

We shared the building with another store and we ourselves had no control over the alarm system in any way. They originally had it set up to automatically arm itself at a certain time without warning, but after they got fined a few times for false alarms and also some complaints from nearby businesses still open after that store closed for the night, they had to remove that function. However, the manager of the other store would effectively force us out of the building by arming it even if we were telling him to give us just a minute, and refused to check the back room first or allow us time to do so. The exit delay was too short for us to even go to the back room and get our coworkers to leave before the alarm was armed. Of course they wouldn't give us a code or even the authority to cancel the alarm if it was accidentally tripped. I can understand us, as employees of another business, not having that, but surely at least the owner of our business should have had at least one of those if not both. 

Later on, when Mr. F***-fire-code-and-all-who-follow-it isn't watching, I move the dartboard out of the way, but I print out a sign to discourage at least those who do pay attention to signs. It basically just says ""EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY"" and a foot note saying ""be sure the door closes behind you""

An emergency exit alarm would be a good idea, but you couldn't convince the owner of our business to get one roll of duct tape for the entire business to share, much less a proper solution to anything. 

The next day I come back, there is a larger arcade machine, too large and heavy for one person to move, blocking the back door, so that dummy had to have gotten someone else to help him.

I did tell the manager by leaving a voicemail, but he was impossible to reach by any means if he wasn't actually there, and he was only there a couple of days a week. Email might have been a better option in some cases, but here, the computer that had access to the owner's email had no password or separate accounts on it, and pop-up notifications were enabled for email. This means that any of my coworkers could easily find my email complaining about them, and either confront me about it, delete it hoping the owner hadn't seen it on his phone or home computer by then, or both.

,TalesFromRetail,"TL,DR; customer wants a discount because he saw it cheaper elsewhere. But I work for the company that *makes* the game. 

As I've said in a previous posting, I don't really work in retail, but during the convention season, my small game company has a booth selling our products in the dealer's room. So we have a rather hot-and-heavy four days of sales activity with hyper-kinetic gamer geeks flush with cash &amp; caffeine and buying everything. 

Couple walks up. ""We saw \[expensive luxury game\] at Other Store and it was $50 cheaper.""

Me: ""Great. You should buy it.""

Couple: ""Don't you want to beat their deal?""

Me: ""Folks, I am literally the manufacturer of \[expensive luxury game\]. Other Store bought their game either from me or from a distributor, who bought it from me. In either case, I already got paid for it once.""

Couple (looking victorious): ""Then why should we buy it from you?""

Me: ""No reason really. Most of those games are bought from other sellers, not from my company directly. Maybe it's cool to get it directly from the designer. I can sign if if you want.""

Couple walks off kind of annoyed. Later they came back and bought a copy from me without any discount. 

WHAT ABOUT RETAIL VS. WHOLESALE? Yes, I get more money from a direct purchase from our booth, but it's not that big a deal, and Lord knows I'm not going to try to undercut the people who buy from me. Also at the convention I'm expecting to sell entirely out of all copies I brought so I have zero interest in discounting any of them. 

The Other Store only had four copies up for sale. I guess they priced them $50 less to make sure they'd sell.

SPOILER ALERT: I do a few things in this tale that probably aren't ""loss prevention protocol"", but there wasn't an LP on duty and I've worked at this place for a long time - on this particular evening I was out of fucks to give.

At about 6pm, a man wearing a black hoodie with the hood pulled up carrying a messenger bag enters the department. I'm on the opposite side of the dept. helping a customer and can't do anything about ""customer servicing"" this guy myself, but I signal to my co-workers to let them know. After a few minutes he comes to my end of things and starts looking at the headphones. I'm now helping a different customer but he's within my peripherals, and I see him grab a couple boxes and slowly head out of the back end of the dept. and behind the other aisles of the store.

I finish with my customer and decide to follow him at a distance, just to get an idea of where he is. Pretending to be looking for a manager, I pass him towards the middle of the store, now with one box in hand, the other one presumably in his bag. I keep walking, but double back right away and get him walking towards the exit - no boxes. He pauses by the pop coolers on the way out of the store, and for some reason I decide to approach him:

Me: ""Hey, just wondering what happened with those boxes you had in your hand when you left electronics?""

Him, rather slowly: ""Uhhh I left them in Aisle X, or maybe Y, I can't remember.""

Me: ""Oh? Can you show me where? Because you're supposed to pay for those in electronics.""

Him: ""Look my memory isn't so good, it was one of those aisles, OK?"" He begins to slowly walk out at this point.

Me, knowing fully this was BS but can't do anything about it: ""Ok ok, well... see ya later"" I eventually mutter as he gets out of earshot.

I then reported him to our ""response centre"" (basically company-wide camera access) and told them everything. This was at around 6:15pm. I also told my co-workers that I was closing with that night, and they told me they had all seen the man looking suspicious and had customer serviced him.

Cut to 8:45pm - we're shutting things down for the night and the SAME FUCKING GUY COMES BACK. WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES with the SAME BAG. But this time, he's brought a similarly dressed friend, a female. I'm thinking ok, classic distraction tactics to try and steal more shit - she'll draw us away from him and he'll do his thing. The others in the dept. took notice and I told them to stay close but not too close.

About 5 minutes go by, they're milling around, and like clockwork they both head to the headphones. I circled around via another aisle, came up the back end and started facing, with my coworker facing the section about 20 feet down: the guy was between us. I kept his friend in my peripherals, but she appeared to be disinterested or wasn't vibing with us being so close by. I approach him. Surely he'd remember me from before...

Me: ""Hi! Anything I can help you find?""

Him: ""No I'm just looking around.""

Me: ""Ok no problem, let me know if you have any questions!""

My co-worker and I continue to face on either side of him, making small talk to keep things natural. He takes a couple of boxes of headphones (almost identical to what he took earlier) in addition to a couple small speakers. He turns to me: ""hey, I don't want these (speakers), can you put them back?"" This guy probably thinks I'm gonna spend precious time and energy putting them back properly, oh no no. I say ""sure"", promptly hand them to my co-worker and stick the same distance away. Like clockwork AGAIN, this guy tries to go around the back side of the dept. and out, but I wasn't having it.

Me: ""Hey, you have to pay for those here.""

Him: ""What if I wanna just pay at the front?""

Me: ""No, you have to pay for them here."" My tone is now getting more aggressive.

Him: ""Since when??"" He's getting defiant as well.

Me: ""Since forever, it's a company policy."" This is where I cut the bullshit.

Me: ""Look man, I've seen you in here earlier! I talked to you by the pop coolers about the EXACT same thing. You have to pay for these here!""

\*this is the best line of the entire interaction\*

Him: ""That wasn't me! That was probably my cousin!""

Me: ""Your cousin?!? Your cousin wears the exact same clothes as you?!?""

Without pausing to analyze how amazing this comeback of his was, I say: ""Look man, I don't care who you are, you have to pay for those here!""

Him: ""Fine, KEEP YOUR STUPID SHIT!"" He throws the headphones in the air, and him and his partner slowly leave the store empty-handed. My co-worker, who witnessed this entire interaction, phones the whole thing in to our response centre, laughing.

I usually stay the fuck away from people like this, because I never know what they might pull. But god damn. The audacity, the gall to come back on the SAME SHIFT wearing the SAME CLOTHES stealing the SAME STUFF is incredible, and I couldn't not share.

Anyway, hope you enjoyed. Love reading the stories here and commiserating with you all. Cheers!

TL;DR - a guy comes in and steals headphones at 6pm, but not before I talk to him about paying for them.

He comes to the counter and asks the price of our cheapest smokes. I tell him and he declines. He then proceeds to put his drink back, get a different one and pay for that instead. 

He leaves the store, then comes back about 30 seconds later. He decides he does in fact want the smokes, but also asks after something for his car. He looks for this, decides against it, then pays for his smokes and leaves. 

Now this is all slightly odd but not too unusual behaviour for my area but it triggered something in me to take a look at the camera footage. At the time I didn’t see anything but looking at it again today showed it all. 

I’ve left out the part where the person with him was wearing a puffy jacket on a hot summers morning. Usually I wouldn’t worry too much about it because she looked about 15 and they do weird things at that age but his behaviour was just weird enough for me to investigate. 

Sure enough, at the moment where he changes his drink, I can see her clear as day slip a box of earphones into her jacket and walk out ahead of him. What I guess happened was that he had planned to buy her some earphones and himself some smokes but didn’t have enough for both. So he decided that the smokes were more important and just told her to steal the box instead. 

I can’t do anything about this now, and honestly probably couldn’t at the time due to policy. But it feels good to know that I was right that something was up. Also the brand she knocked off is notorious for breaking quickly so I’ll take the win on that one.",t2_qlyy9,False,,0,False,Always trust your instincts,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,medium,0,,False,t3_l3ezft,False,dark,0.97,,public,727,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,727,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1611447412.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;On mobile, please forgive any formatting errors. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"So, it was my first day after being transferred to this electronic retailer location… and it was eventful.

It is important to start our journey by explaining that we sold cell phones and really pushed our propriety own warranty on the phones. It was truly a rip-off because of all the things that it does not cover and frequently got complaints.   
 

This guy comes in wanted to use the warranty because his phone no longer works, and he cannot specify why. He also will not allow me to examine it until the new one is on. Normally I would insist but it is merely a $14 phone and I ran out of effs to give ages ago with this awful company.  
 

As I am processing, I spot the problem. The phone is missing the battery and back cover. Per policy I cannot accept it unless it is complete. I call over the manager because he can authorize me to continue. Now the finally just admits that he lost it.  
 

Still, I would rather just give the guy a new phone, but the manager says no. Apparently, the manager was on the edge of being demoted so he did not want the inevitable charge-back when the shipment center received an incomplete device.

After the manager explains the policy a second time, the customer blows his top and screams “IF I DON’T GET MY PHONE, I WILL SMASH YOUR FACE THROUGH THE COUNTER!!!” This is laughable as the manager is, at least relative to this guy, a giant.

After a heated exchange, the guy storms out with the counter thankfully intact.

A moment later an elderly man dressed in his Sunday best comes in and says “I am so sorry for my son’s behavior. He didn’t cause too much trouble, did he?”

,TalesFromRetail,"So when I was younger (about 10 years ago) I worked for a small off-license (liquor store) that specialised in fine wines and rare spirits - while also keeping business going with the run of the mill stuff. I went from unemployed to assistant manager to manager within 10 months of starting there.

We had many lovely and loyal customers who earned nicknames;

The Dog Walker; who came in with her dog two or three times a week and would just chat.

The Major; who just reminded me of Major from Fawlty Towers.

Mini Man; A man who would only buy spirits by miniature size (5cl) - I assume to hide it from a partner.

And lots of people who were known by the product they'd buy; Boddingtons Man, Smirnoff Guy and Malbec Lady - the superheroes of the store, and my favourite Whiskey Gent who used to work as a journalist for a well known broadcaster in the UK - amazing stories from the world of politics and sport.

This story pertains to someone who was nick-named ""the hairy shoplifter"" (THS) I don't think they needs an explanation?

So a few years in to the job, I must have seen THS three or four times a week. He had shoplifted under previous owners but new manager, new store (basically) so any ban he had been given in the past was gone (even though the majority of the staff were unchanged).

THS is browsing and quite blatantly slips a bottle of wine in to his sleeve and walks out. At the time it was busy and I just couldn't be arsed to deal with reporting it properly, calling the police, waiting for a report - £6 bottle = £0.80 profit to the store (more to the franchise owner).

So I write it off as a loss and get on with work and life. However in the back of my mind I knew that wouldn't be the last I saw of him. Sure enough 2 weeks later. He's back in the store, this time it is much quieter. He picks up a few items and brings them to the till.

The till was fairly old so was still manual typing - after two years I had basically memorised the price of every item in the store (at the very least those that were purchased regularly). He on the other hand does not. So I managed to price up the items adding in the price of the bottle they had mysteriously disappeared.

THS said that it was more than he thought it would be, so I said something to the effect of we've recently upped prices due to some unexpected losses over the last month. THS understood (I think) smirked, nodded and paid and then went on his way.

My lasting question was always, I wonder what he managed to hide (and how) that made paying the extra worth his while...

We have a high minimum $ amount for delivery (most local florists have a minimum + delivery fee). Our fees have stayed the same since the pandemic, but we've upped most of our arrangements by $5-10 to help cover some losses. Our prices are high, but we specialize in very full and/or large arrangements to make up for it. This is a conversation I had with an entitled woman:

Me: Just letting you know, all our arrangements start at $75. The total after tax and delivery for the product you've chosen comes up to about $105

Karen: WHAT? That is ridiculous. You charge THAT MUCH?

Me: Yes. Would you like to proceed?

Karen: THAT'S CRAZY.... WHY

Me: The owners felt this was the best way to ensure great quality products and a fair living wage for our employees - especially during these times.

Karen: Well we've ALL got issues going on right now! That's not an excuse. Some of us are unemployed! You should not be increasing the prices at OUR expense. You should internally have a meeting and take the wages out of the owners and employees so we don't have to pay so much for your ridiculously expensive flowers. YOU CAN'T DO THIS AT THE CUSTOMER'S EXPENSE!! TELL THE OWNERS.

Me: Ma'am, it seems like we may not be the right fit for you and are unable to give you the experience you deserve. Would you like me to refer you to another florist?

Karen: UGH NO. Let's just finish this order. BUT YOU'VE LOST ME AS A FUTURE CUSTOMER

I work as a cashier at a typical hardware store, and I get my fair share of jerks. A lot of days I’m drained after only being there a little while. 

Today, however, my manager beckoned me over and told me someone had complimented me - they apparently said I helped them a lot and I was very sweet. 
It may not seem that amazing but it made my night so much more enjoyable. Just knowing that I made someone’s day better makes my day. I don’t expect feedback or compliments, but on the rare occasion it happens, it makes me so happy! 

That’s it for that, so here’s my final message to you people: Whenever you feel whoever is providing you service, be it cashier, waitress, or other, did a good job, let someone know! It can brighten someone’s otherwise crappy day. :)

This one is rather recent - I got trained behind the customer service desk in a big company that rhymes with mesco in the UK. We sell the lottery - lotto, euromillions, thunderball, set for life, etc. 

This woman came in one day and asked for a lotto ticket on a Thursday, lotto is only on a Wednesday or Saturday so I asked her if she wanted it for Saturday, she said no. She wanted it for tonight. I informed her lotto was not done on a Thursday and Thursday was thunderball, set for life or the health board lottery. She legitimately went from nice to angry in a second. Like I flipped a switch.   
This woman is now called CW - Crazy Woman

""No I always buy the lotto on a Thursday""   
""You can buy the lotto for Thursday but the draw is Wednesday or Saturday""   
""No! It is tonight""   
""I'm very sorry ma'am but I have the machine in front of me which tells me what games are going on which days, tonight is set for life, thunderball or health board lottery""   
""No it isn't! Tonight is lotto, give me a lotto"" - she yelled at this point   
""I can print off a lotto but this will be for Saturday, once printed you will need to pay for it, is this okay?""   
""No, lotto is on a f\*\*king Thursday, I buy this every week"" - I have NEVER seen this woman before   
""Okay I'm going to print you off a lotto"" I said defeated and printed off LOTTO - like she asked. She read the ticket and hit the roof that it said ""SATURDAY"" on it. Slammed it on the table and cursed at me,   
""I f\*\*king said Thursday""   
""Okay ma'am what colour is the ticket you're after?"" (Lotto is red, thunderball is purple, euromillions is yellow, etc)   
""It's purple, like it's always f\*\*king been""   
""I'm sorry ma'am, the thunder ball is purple, but thunder ball is on a Thursday, is that the one you're after maybe?""   
""Why are you lying? Lotto is purple""   
""I'm not lying, thunder ball is purple, but the lotto is red""   
""Lotto is not f\*\*king red, will you get me someone who knows what they're doing?""""   
At this point I called down my manager who is a gem, he loves me, we're amazing friends and get along really well. I explained to him what was happening and he said,   
""I'm sorry miss, my colleague is right. Lotto is on a Wednesday and Saturday and is indeed red"". The woman looked homicide.   
""Okay ma'am, why don't you go down to the lottery station down there, pick out the paper slip you want and choose your numbers, then I can put it through and give you your ticket"" I said trying to help still.   
""No I want you to do your job and put my numbers in"" - she then told me her numbers. 5. 5 Numbers. Lotto is SIX numbers, wanna know what lottery is 5? THUNDER BALL. I explained this to her and she threw her hands up in dismay,   
""Fine, f\*\*king print me off a thunder ball""  - I did. With her numbers. Silence. I saw the colour from this woman's face drain. She looked sheepish.   
""Did I help you find what you're looking for?"" I asked nicely - my manager trying to hold back his laughter. The woman looked mad, but couldn't say jack to me.   
""Yes, thank you"" she grumbled, paid, and left.

TLDR at the bottom;

Okay so this happened when I was 18, I got a new job at a bridal shop. In this shop. you can wear shoes and buy off the rack, or order, we do alterations and nothing we sell is over $1,800. Now we are appointment based but we take walk-ins. Now we also sell bridesmaid, prom, quinceañera, and other fancy event dresses.

The event: One day a girl walks in with 8 Bridemaids and her mother. I greeted them and asked if they had an appointment.

NB: No, do we need one?

Me: we are appointment based but--

MZ: Now listen her you stupid b\*\*\* This is baby special day and we will be trying on dresses!

Me: I understand We do take walk-ins but we are appointment based.

MZ: Shut up and help us NOW,

NB: mom calm down, can you pencil us in today?

ME: Not a problem we are pretty slow today and I have an available stylist right now.

NB: thank you so much!

MZ just rolls her eyes and starts looking at dresses. I thought that was the end... I was very wrong. About 20 minutes later MZ comes storming towards me.

ME: Oh hello MZ can I help you?

MZ: Yes you can, tell that b\*\*\*\* to bring it out now!

Me, starting to loose my cool: I am sorry, bring what out?

MZ: THE COUCHES AND CHAMPANGE!!! I AM NOT PAYING FOR THIS APPOINTMENT WITHOUT IT!

ME: Ma'am you need to lower your voice. You do not have to pay because this is a free appointment, also we do not have couches, and you will have to sit in chair instead, lastly, we do not have or serve champagne we would need a license and to have all employees be 21, so we cannot do that.

MZ broke down in tears, that is when GM comes in.

GM: what's going on here?

MZ: YOU'R. STUPID. EMLOYEES. WONT. GIVE. ME. CHAAAAAAMPAGE!

GM ended up kicking her out of the store. NB finished her appointment and found the perfect dress, I never had to see NZ ever again

""Nope. $65.  Firm.""

Bob: ""Take $45?""

I had a line forming.  ""I'll take $45 now.""

He hands over the cash.  He's got hundreds in his wallet.  I put the filter on the back shelf.  But put ""Bob, paid $45"" on it.

Bob: ""What? Give me the part?""

,TalesFromRetail,"My story is about my manager’s vendetta against the Bobleh Blorres Ring of Thieves. Obviously, that is not his real name.

These guys would steal thousands of dollars of merch and return them to our other locations for store credit. We start to recognize certain members of the ring, but they change it up enough that they keep getting away with it.

My boss… the lady… The legend.  She was our fearless leader and if anyone steals from her… she will make sure that they don't get away with it.. I still have a tremendous amount of respect for her.

For some context here, corporate overlords had no will to press charges against anyone even when the evidence was airtight, so we knew that getting Bobleh arrested was not necessary, realistic, or effective.

The Boss starts with some basic deterrence at the beginning. We sold a fake security camera that she mounted in key areas. Corporate was too cheap to pay for a real system… which we ironically also sold.

Then we started gathering info. If anyone returned anything, we would look them up with their return history. If they had returned anything substantial at any of our other locations, we would hang on to the personal information. We also clued in the other locations to do the same.

Between the stores we were able to assemble a list of names of probable members of this ring and we knew for certain that Bobleh is the ringleader.

One day, the man himself, Bobleh Blorres, shows up with his partner. We knew the deal. The partner distracts the associate while the other steals. This time though we were ready. The boss was friends with a local cop. She shoots the cop friend a text while my co-worker has the thief… well… a captive audience. My co-worker… he is a super smart techie… but tends to not pick up social cues and has the thief literally cornered as he talks about camera specs. This thief is just freaking out as the cop car rolls up and co-worker just does not notice.

All 6’ 6” of this cop strolls in and walks right up to Bobleh, gets in his face, and sternly says “We know what you are up to and if you come back in here, you’ll regret it!”

Bobleh and his goon literally run out of the store so fast that he drops his hat and just leaves it!

Funny thing was that his hat reeked of paint thinner. Is that a drug thing? I have no idea. I stuck it to the wall in the break room as a trophy.

I have one big regret in all of this. During Bobleh’s last visit… I was on the effing toilet.

We never saw Bobleh again. I like to think that maybe he turned his life around but that is a lot to hope for.

Sorry about that.",t2_94mfavl5,False,,0,False,Reckoning for the Bobleh Blorres Ring of Thieves,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,medium,0,,False,t3_l0zo17,False,dark,0.95,,public,82,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,82,,False,,1611111553.0,,[],{},,True,,1611138730.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My story is about my manager’s vendetta against the Bobleh Blorres Ring of Thieves. Obviously, that is not his real name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys would steal thousands of dollars of merch and return them to our other locations for store credit. We start to recognize certain members of the ring, but they change it up enough that they keep getting away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boss… the lady… The legend.  She was our fearless leader and if anyone steals from her… she will make sure that they don&amp;#39;t get away with it.. I still have a tremendous amount of respect for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some context here, corporate overlords had no will to press charges against anyone even when the evidence was airtight, so we knew that getting Bobleh arrested was not necessary, realistic, or effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boss starts with some basic deterrence at the beginning. We sold a fake security camera that she mounted in key areas. Corporate was too cheap to pay for a real system… which we ironically also sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we started gathering info. If anyone returned anything, we would look them up with their return history. If they had returned anything substantial at any of our other locations, we would hang on to the personal information. We also clued in the other locations to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the stores we were able to assemble a list of names of probable members of this ring and we knew for certain that Bobleh is the ringleader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, the man himself, Bobleh Blorres, shows up with his partner. We knew the deal. The partner distracts the associate while the other steals. This time though we were ready. The boss was friends with a local cop. She shoots the cop friend a text while my co-worker has the thief… well… a captive audience. My co-worker… he is a super smart techie… but tends to not pick up social cues and has the thief literally cornered as he talks about camera specs. This thief is just freaking out as the cop car rolls up and co-worker just does not notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 6’ 6” of this cop strolls in and walks right up to Bobleh, gets in his face, and sternly says “We know what you are up to and if you come back in here, you’ll regret it!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bobleh and his goon literally run out of the store so fast that he drops his hat and just leaves it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing was that his hat reeked of paint thinner. Is that a drug thing? I have no idea. I stuck it to the wall in the break room as a trophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one big regret in all of this. During Bobleh’s last visit… I was on the effing toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never saw Bobleh again. I like to think that maybe he turned his life around but that is a lot to hope for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like this story is still clunky.  Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"Back in the mid 1980s I worked at a chain record store that sold records, tapes, T-Shirts, and other music-related items. One day I was standing at the front register waiting for customers to check out and in walks a very angry looking man. 

He tosses two 45 RPM records on the counter and said, “I want to return these.”

I looked down at the two 45’s and noticed that they were warped. And when I say “warped,” I mean that they had more waves than Farrah Fawcett’s hair on her famous poster. These 45’s put Shirley Temple to shame. It was summer, so it was pretty obvious that these records were left in the man’s car all day.

I said, “Sir, we can’t take these back, they’ve obviously been damaged by the sun.”

I kid you not, he looked me square in the eyes and said, “I didn’t do a thing to them, they were this way when I bought them! Now I want a refund!”

Dumbfounded, I asked, “You actually bought them like that?”

He had the presence of mind to look embarrassed but recovered quickly and asked to speak to our manager.

I called over to Jimmy, the assistant manager on duty and started to explain the issue. The customer interrupted and said, “I want to return these, but your employee here won’t help me.”

Now Jimmy was an imposing guy with a no-nonsense attitude. I fully expected him to kick this poor, delusional soul out of the store, but he surprised me by saying, “Okay.”

Honestly, to say I was surprised is an understatement - I was shocked! Jimmy came around the counter to the register, processed the return, and threw the 45’s in our return box. He turned to the customer and said, “Will there be anything else, sir?”

The customer smiled smugly and replied, “I don’t know if I’ll be back here anymore if y’all hire people like her.”

Jimmy just smiled and said, “That will be fine sir, we don’t want to deal with any more warped records either.”

The man just huffed and walked out of the store.

,TalesFromRetail,"This is my second Reddit post. My first ran afoul of the rules here so I deleted it.  Please forgive me and let me know if I am violating any norms/rules. I’ll figure it out.

In collage I worked at an electronics retailer.  One crazy evening a guy showed up demanding a refund on an item. He had everything, even his receipt. By all rights, a refund was no issue whatsoever but if that were all I would not be here. He demanded cash but he originally paid with card. I explained that policy required that the return be done according to the method originally used to pay and specifically the card that he used. 

He angerly claimed that card account was closed. I explained that my boss could override that, but she would not be in until the next day. This back and forth continued for several minutes as this guy got angrier and angrier. Now it is important to note, this guy is roughly 6’ 4” and easily north of 300 pounds. At this point he produces the card he used, showing that he lied. Whatever. We did the return and he left. This is where it gets crazy. 

It was 15 minutes past closing by this point and we are anxious to leave. It’s just myself and a co-worker when we hear this guy screaming obscenities at the sky. My co-worker makes what I would consider a mistake. He goes out in front of the store to see what is going on. Almost immediately these 2 enter the chicken walk that macho people do squaring up to fight. It is important to note here, although I did not know it at the time, that my co-worker was also an MMA fighter. The guy did that dumb bum tackle where he hunches over and charges my co-worker who immediately puts the guy into a guillotine head lock. My co-worker handles the guy like a cattleman might handle an ornery calf. There were no blows buy my co-worker dominated while this guys wife came screaming out of his truck. I realized at some point in this that I was of no help. I wrote the license plate of the guy on my palm with a sharpie and called the cops. 

This is where is got scary. My co-worker released the guy figuring that he was done. The guy lumbered back to his truck like a brain-dead pachyderm. We thought he was trying to leave but he immediately returned and ‘stabbed’ my co-worker with something he picked up from his truck. Whatever it was, it apparently was not a knife. After that, the guy and his wife take off. 

The cops arrive a few minutes later. They plugged his license plate number into their on-board computer and the guy’s mug shot pops up on their screen. From what I can see, he was previously wanted for drug related offenses. I can only figure that he was high and thought that the object he grabbed was a knife. He certainly swung it like one. Because there was no actual injury, no charges were pressed; however, my co-worker was arrested a few years later for running a human trafficking ring including torture of women. Did you see that coming? If the admins approve, I may add his name as it is public record and in the news. He will never leave prison.

We thought he was trying to leave but he immediately returned and ‘stabbed’ my co-worker with something he picked up from his truck. Whatever it was, it apparently was not a knife. After that, the guy and his wife take off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cops arrive a few minutes later. They plugged his license plate number into their on-board computer and the guy’s mug shot pops up on their screen. From what I can see, he was previously wanted for drug related offenses. I can only figure that he was high and thought that the object he grabbed was a knife. He certainly swung it like one. Because there was no actual injury, no charges were pressed; however, my co-worker was arrested a few years later for running a human trafficking ring including torture of women. Did you see that coming? If the admins approve, I may add his name as it is public record and in the news. He will never leave prison.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

I was dragging the ladder because although it can be pushed, it's about ten times easier to drag it and everybody does so.

The two customers were in the same area about three or four feet apart; I said ""Excuse me"" in a reasonably loud tone to overshadow the terrible FM radio loop. The father who was a little closer to me heard and escorted himself and his daughter out of the way. Toe Lady, who was on the phone with an inside voice the approximate decibel level of a jet engine, did not move immediately; I repeated myself two more times and finally, she started edging to the left. *Finally,* I think and continue dragging the ladder and dragging out my time. And a happy ending...nope, this is retail, ""happy ending"" isn't in the SOP.

I dragged the ladder while looking over my shoulder so I have a blind spot literally behind me because, ya know, don't have eyes on the back of my head.

""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I was saying *Excuse me* earlier, I said it several times, I saw you move and I thought you saw me coming.""

""No-o, if you'd said it, I would've heard you!!!"" she retorts. I'm internally screaming as she semi-limps a short distance away. I'm not doubting she was in pain at the moment, but as I said, it would've passed in about five minutes. ""I need to call a manager,"" she says. ""I don't know if this will be worse in the morning.""

So called the manager, he gets both sides of the story, takes an incident report, gives Toe Lady a health line to call, and she's off.

,TalesFromRetail,"Hi TFR - I have enjoyed reading this thread for a while, now making my first post.

This happened about a few years ago. I worked for one as a sales rep for one of the larger phone carriers in the U.S. It was a slow night and the store was empty, when this guy came in. He wanted to upgrade his phone 1 (P1), which he had just got two months ago on monthly payments. He also was not on our upgrade program. He had already decided he wanted phone 2 (P2). At this point he owed about $550 on P1 and the trade in value was only about $100, yeah trade was horrible rates at the time. I told him about this and he said he didn't care. He then went on for 10 minutes bragging about how he just got a raise, is making crazy money, he can afford to buy 5 of the P2. I just sat there listening to him. I then told him, that I wouldn't recommend trading in P1 because he would still have to making monthly payments on the remaining balance, plus another monthly payment for P2, which was more expensive phone. I should note he wasn't the primary on the account his wife was, but he was authorized. I asked if his wife would be ok with it and he said, he didn’t need her permission to do what he wants. He ended up trading in P1 and getting P2 plus he spent over $400 on accessories. All along I continued to recommend that he not do this. Before making the sale or trade in, I got my manager involved, so he could talk to the customer and make sure the customer understood what he was doing. In all I told him 7 times not to do it, plus my manager twice. He still did it. So after the sale, following the CYA procedure, I made notes in the account detailing everything that happened.

Fast forward two days, the store gets a call and they ask for me. It was customer service, who had the wife on the phone, who wanted to talk to me. I 'll be ME, the wife will 
TW, and Customer Service will be CS.

ME: Thank you for calling (store name), this is (my name).

CS: Hi ____, I have TW on the phone and she wanted to talk about the sale you made to her husband.

ME: Ok, what can I do or you TW?

TW: Do you think what you did was ok?

ME: I'm sorry, what was that?

TW: Do you think what you did was ok? Taking advantage of my husband?

ME: I'm not sure what you mean.

TW: You convinced my husband, to buy and new phone and you took his two month old phone and gave him basically nothing for it.

ME: I understand. Ma’am, I informed your husband many times about what would happen and recommended multiple times that he should not do that.

TW: (Raising her voice) That is bad business and unethical, you should not have sold him anything.!!! I am a business owner and I would never take advantage of a customer the way you did. If you knew it was a bad idea, it's your job not to sell it.

ME: Maam, I made (cuts me off)

TW: Seriously what you did is just unethical and wrong do you understand that? What you did is illegal, you can't sell it to him, if you think its wrong.

ME: I know (cuts me off again)

TW: You should not have sold it to him, we want the phone he traded in back.? We are also returning all the accessories you sold him on. This is so messed up.

Now, I'm getting annoyed for being blamed for this, it's clear the husband told her a different story. I didn't mention to her, people do things like this at least once a month.

ME: Ok. I made every effort to help your husband, he came into our store bragging about how much money he's making and how he can buy whatever he wanted, even five of these phones. That said, I even got my manager involved so he could hear it from someone else. You (cuts me off).

TW: Oh, even you manager was in on it. Wait until I talk to corporate about your stores unethical tactics.

ME: Ok, TW. At this point there's nothing I can do for you on the phone, you can return the accessories, and if you'd lilke, you can talk to my manager about what happened when you get here. Anything else I can do for you?

TW: Tell me why you sold the phone to him and thouhght is ok to do?

ME: Ma’am, as I told you, you can discuss this with my manager when you get here. Anything else I can do for you?

TW: Yeah, answer my last question. This is just bad business.

ME: Once again ma’am, there's nothing on the phone I can do for you, we will gladly help you in the store, when you get here. Have a good day. (Hang up)

The one thing I was not going to tell her over the phone, is that once her husband traded in the phone, there was not way to get it back, as all trade-ins are final. His trade-in phone was already shipped out.

The couple came in later that day and she was pissed. The husband however, didn't say a word. I'll skip the dialoge on this one because it way too long. Simply put, my manager backed me up the entire time he helped them return the accessories. I couldn't help myself and went over there, and starting repeating everything that the husband had bragged to me about and I even added the line about how he didn't need his wife permission. The look she gave him when I said that was the best redemption I could ever have. He tried blaming everything on me and now I was able to bury him for it. After that, she lightened up a little. She then returned the new phone, removed his name a authorized user, and bought him a flip phone.

He wanted to upgrade his phone 1 (P1), which he had just got two months ago on monthly payments. He also was not on our upgrade program. He had already decided he wanted phone 2 (P2). At this point he owed about $550 on P1 and the trade in value was only about $100, yeah trade was horrible rates at the time. I told him about this and he said he didn&amp;#39;t care. He then went on for 10 minutes bragging about how he just got a raise, is making crazy money, he can afford to buy 5 of the P2. I just sat there listening to him. I then told him, that I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend trading in P1 because he would still have to making monthly payments on the remaining balance, plus another monthly payment for P2, which was more expensive phone. I should note he wasn&amp;#39;t the primary on the account his wife was, but he was authorized. I asked if his wife would be ok with it and he said, he didn’t need her permission to do what he wants. He ended up trading in P1 and getting P2 plus he spent over $400 on accessories. All along I continued to recommend that he not do this. Before making the sale or trade in, I got my manager involved, so he could talk to the customer and make sure the customer understood what he was doing. In all I told him 7 times not to do it, plus my manager twice. He still did it. So after the sale, following the CYA procedure, I made notes in the account detailing everything that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward two days, the store gets a call and they ask for me. It was customer service, who had the wife on the phone, who wanted to talk to me. I &amp;#39;ll be ME, the wife will 
TW, and Customer Service will be CS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Thank you for calling (store name), this is (my name).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CS: Hi ____, I have TW on the phone and she wanted to talk about the sale you made to her husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Ok, what can I do or you TW?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Do you think what you did was ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: I&amp;#39;m sorry, what was that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Do you think what you did was ok? Taking advantage of my husband?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: I&amp;#39;m not sure what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: You convinced my husband, to buy and new phone and you took his two month old phone and gave him basically nothing for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: I understand. Ma’am, I informed your husband many times about what would happen and recommended multiple times that he should not do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: (Raising her voice) That is bad business and unethical, you should not have sold him anything.!!! I am a business owner and I would never take advantage of a customer the way you did. If you knew it was a bad idea, it&amp;#39;s your job not to sell it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Maam, I made (cuts me off)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Seriously what you did is just unethical and wrong do you understand that? What you did is illegal, you can&amp;#39;t sell it to him, if you think its wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: I know (cuts me off again)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: You should not have sold it to him, we want the phone he traded in back.? We are also returning all the accessories you sold him on. This is so messed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m getting annoyed for being blamed for this, it&amp;#39;s clear the husband told her a different story. I didn&amp;#39;t mention to her, people do things like this at least once a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Ok. I made every effort to help your husband, he came into our store bragging about how much money he&amp;#39;s making and how he can buy whatever he wanted, even five of these phones. That said, I even got my manager involved so he could hear it from someone else. You (cuts me off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Oh, even you manager was in on it. Wait until I talk to corporate about your stores unethical tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Ok, TW. At this point there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do for you on the phone, you can return the accessories, and if you&amp;#39;d lilke, you can talk to my manager about what happened when you get here. Anything else I can do for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Tell me why you sold the phone to him and thouhght is ok to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Ma’am, as I told you, you can discuss this with my manager when you get here. Anything else I can do for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TW: Yeah, answer my last question. This is just bad business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ME: Once again ma’am, there&amp;#39;s nothing on the phone I can do for you, we will gladly help you in the store, when you get here. Have a good day. (Hang up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing I was not going to tell her over the phone, is that once her husband traded in the phone, there was not way to get it back, as all trade-ins are final. His trade-in phone was already shipped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple came in later that day and she was pissed. The husband however, didn&amp;#39;t say a word. I&amp;#39;ll skip the dialoge on this one because it way too long. Simply put, my manager backed me up the entire time he helped them return the accessories. I couldn&amp;#39;t help myself and went over there, and starting repeating everything that the husband had bragged to me about and I even added the line about how he didn&amp;#39;t need his wife permission. The look she gave him when I said that was the best redemption I could ever have. He tried blaming everything on me and now I was able to bury him for it. After that, she lightened up a little. She then returned the new phone, removed his name a authorized user, and bought him a flip phone.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I used to work at a fairly large sporting goods store. This was a while ago, back when Heelys were still a thing (are they still a thing?). Our store received a promotional display with a large three foot sign with red lettering that said Heelys in the form the sole of a shoe. They also put a large spinning wheel in it too, it was pretty cool, kids loved it.

However for some reason this sign was absolutely invisible, like some how the company had put on special paint that made it invisible to the eyes of adults, must be the same paint they use to make ""Out of Order"" signs. Anyway, here is the story.

""Where are your Heelys?"" a woman demands as she approaches me in the shoe department. ""I've been through this whole store and I can't find them. I was told they're here.""

""Yes ma'am, I'll take you to them."" I bring her to the display and think it a little obvious because of the large sign. But I put my hand on the display, just for that little extra obviousness, and turn around. ""Here you go ma'am.""

The woman continued to stare at me, eyes locked onto me like a hawk. So I started to gesture to the large sign that said Heelys. She still doesn't see it. I even tried to do a little Vanna White gesture towards the sign and display. Still nothing. By this point I'm gesturing with two hands towards the sign, display and individual shoes on the display. Nope, she just stared at me like I was a mime acting out the old invisible box routine. ""Um... they are right here ma'am.""

""Where?"" she asks throwing up her arms and finally drawing her eyes away from me looking ten feet above my head. ""Where are the Heelys?"" She practically yells to the heavens.

I turn my head slowly to see where she is looking. I start to think this must be some kind of practical joke or some kind of candid camera. Standing in the presence of something as dense as a neutron star is causing a violent reaction in my brain and I have my first aneurysm. My coworker who was watching the entire scene play out, finally manages to put on a straight face and come to my rescue.

""Hi ma'am are you looking for Heelys?"" he asks her calmly.

""Yes!"" she says frustrated with the service that I had been providing her.

""I am not sure if we have some in stock right now but if you follow me I am sure we can find some,"" he tells her leading her away from the display. He got her to do a half circuit around the store before returning back to the same place in front of the Heelys display where the whole incident took place.

""I am sorry ma'am they had the display in the power aisle earlier."" It was a half truth, it was in fact in the power aisle last month but moved to the shoe department because people kept blocking the entire aisle crowding around the display. ""I know we are expecting a new shipment soon. I would check back early next week.""

""Oh well, thank you for your time,"" she tells him as he casually leans against the large obnoxious Heelys display. This guy is a magician. I bring her to what she wants, she gets mad at me, my coworker  makes her walk around the store for nothing and she is grateful for it. 

""No problem ma'am enjoy the rest of your day,"" he tells her and we wait until she is out of ear shot. He turns to me and completely looses it. For five minutes he cannot stop laughing, he then stands in front of the Heelys display, throws up his arms and shouts to the heavens, ""Where are the Heelys?""

Whenever a customer asks where the Heelys are, I just tell them ""right down there and look down, you can't miss it."" I never went near that display if I could help it.

Edit: this was a long time ago, like fresh out of high school long time ago. I had not yet picked up the skills to effectively communicate with customers as I had effectively grown up getting the verbal stiffarm by the adults around me when asking vague questions.

,TalesFromRetail,"Hi! Here's one of my encounters from two of my customers. 

So a bit of a background here, Me and a friend of mine own an online business store that sells toy collections and hobby items. One of the items that we are selling are toy lightsabers, the ones made out of polycarbonate tubes that is good for collectors, cosplayers and its also sturdy enough to be used for dueling. 

We were clear about the categories of our items (toys and hobby items) when we post our products, especially on the captions itself. We specify the description and the functions and even have actual pictures of the items on the post so that there was only minimal questions that the customers would require to ask from us, at least they got the details down immediately. 

Take note, we have pictures of both the lightsaber turned on to show the light effect, and turned off to show what the polycarbonate tube looks like (the ""blade"" of the lightsaber"")

So on to the exchange with two of the customers through private messaging that had me infuriated by all means...

.

**CUSTOMER #1**

*\*Customer sends screenshot of the product\**

Customer: its reall

*\*I was confused with the message so instead i sent this:\** 

Me: Hi! We have two hilt color variants for that model available on hand. Its for \*price\* if you're interested. 

Customer: Can I request for a sample video of the saber? 

*\*We couldnt send a sample video immediately because the one we had is being edited (it was a demonstration skit so some parts had to be cutted out) so I dont have any access to it, so instead i apologized and gave the customer some up close sample pictures of the lightsaber itself\** 

Me: We do apologize but we cant send any videos of the sabers yet, but here are some up close pics of the lightsaber itself so you could see the details on the hilt. 

Customer: It's real blades? 

*\*Me confused with the question, because why it would be real blade, its a lightsaber. Plus years of phone customer service taught me to keep a positive phrasing and not to say outright ""No."" Unless theyre being very stupid already\** 

Me: The Blades are made out of 36"" Polycarbonate Tube with 1"" diameter 

Customer: Can I see the video and the sharpness of the blade

*\*at this point, I was already stressing out because i clearly stated that the ""blade"" of the lightsaber was a tube and not an actual blade\** 

Me: We will send you a video momentarily. As for the blade, its a polycarbonate tube to represent the lightsaber's ""Laser blade"" its not made out of sharp material. 

Customer: I will buy item but i wait for the video and sample use

*\*Ive sent him the video of the lightsaber which was supposed to be for our demo vid\** 

Customer: ahmmm thats a blade or toy maam/sir

*\*I didnt get if that was a question or a statement, but I answered anyway, at this point I was already passive agressive because of the stupid questions, and customer learly wasnt looking at the pics nor the descriptions we had on the post\**

Me: As mentioned in the post and previous message, the ""Blade"" is made up of polucarbonate tube. It is not an actual blade. This is a toy lightsaber best for collectors, cosplayers and duelists. 

End of conversation (*customer seen zoned me*)

*\*on the onset of the chat, the customer immediately asked a question\**

Customer: Does the laser hurt? or light? 

*\*I was still reeling from that previous conversation with the other customer, and now this guy appears and ask a stupid question\** 

Me: Hello! The lightsaber blades are made out of polycarbonate tube.

Customer: The light can shock? 

*\*Me, controlling the urge to stop myself from calling out the customer not reading the descriptions of our items\**

Me: This blade is similar to a flashlight's LED that lights up the blade to produce that ""laser blade"" effect. The light does have a ""flashing"" effect, but it doesnt have any electric shock that may cause harm to the user.

*\*seriously though, why would we sell weapons when it was obvious we sold toys, its in our goddamn store description\**

**TL;DR - Conversation with two customers who thought that the toy lightsabers that we sold for cosplays, collectors and duelists were actual real lightsabers. XD**",t2_1afxrpzq,False,,0,False,Real Lightsabers,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,long,0,,False,t3_kuju37,False,dark,0.96,,public,87,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,87,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1610332194.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! Here&amp;#39;s one of my encounters from two of my customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a bit of a background here, Me and a friend of mine own an online business store that sells toy collections and hobby items. One of the items that we are selling are toy lightsabers, the ones made out of polycarbonate tubes that is good for collectors, cosplayers and its also sturdy enough to be used for dueling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were clear about the categories of our items (toys and hobby items) when we post our products, especially on the captions itself. We specify the description and the functions and even have actual pictures of the items on the post so that there was only minimal questions that the customers would require to ask from us, at least they got the details down immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note, we have pictures of both the lightsaber turned on to show the light effect, and turned off to show what the polycarbonate tube looks like (the &amp;quot;blade&amp;quot; of the lightsaber&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on to the exchange with two of the customers through private messaging that had me infuriated by all means...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUSTOMER #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;Customer sends screenshot of the product**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: its reall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;I was confused with the message so instead i sent this:** &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Hi! We have two hilt color variants for that model available on hand. Its for *price* if you&amp;#39;re interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: Can I request for a sample video of the saber? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;We couldnt send a sample video immediately because the one we had is being edited (it was a demonstration skit so some parts had to be cutted out) so I dont have any access to it, so instead i apologized and gave the customer some up close sample pictures of the lightsaber itself** &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: We do apologize but we cant send any videos of the sabers yet, but here are some up close pics of the lightsaber itself so you could see the details on the hilt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: It&amp;#39;s real blades? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;Me confused with the question, because why it would be real blade, its a lightsaber. Plus years of phone customer service taught me to keep a positive phrasing and not to say outright &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Unless theyre being very stupid already** &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: The Blades are made out of 36&amp;quot; Polycarbonate Tube with 1&amp;quot; diameter &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: Can I see the video and the sharpness of the blade&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;at this point, I was already stressing out because i clearly stated that the &amp;quot;blade&amp;quot; of the lightsaber was a tube and not an actual blade** &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: We will send you a video momentarily. As for the blade, its a polycarbonate tube to represent the lightsaber&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Laser blade&amp;quot; its not made out of sharp material. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: I will buy item but i wait for the video and sample use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;Ive sent him the video of the lightsaber which was supposed to be for our demo vid** &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: ahmmm thats a blade or toy maam/sir&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;I didnt get if that was a question or a statement, but I answered anyway, at this point I was already passive agressive because of the stupid questions, and customer learly wasnt looking at the pics nor the descriptions we had on the post**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: As mentioned in the post and previous message, the &amp;quot;Blade&amp;quot; is made up of polucarbonate tube. It is not an actual blade. This is a toy lightsaber best for collectors, cosplayers and duelists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of conversation (&lt;em&gt;customer seen zoned me&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUSTOMER #2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(this is a rather short conversation, but still stupid)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;on the onset of the chat, the customer immediately asked a question**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer: Does the laser hurt? or light? &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I work in a drugstore that also has photo printing services. This incident happened a few weeks ago, during peak holiday season. 

A lady and her husband come in to use the self service photo kiosk and prints off, we'll  say 173 photos. While they're printing, she shops around while her pictures are printing and picks out 1 item. I dont remember what it was, but we'll say it was a chapstick. (It was something less than 4 dollars)

Once her photos are done printing, she brings the pictures plus her chapstick up to the counter, and hands me a coupon for $1 off Healthcare items. 

Now, were really busy, and the way our system works, you have to scan a barcode for 4x6 photos and enter the quantity to make the system calculate the total. The max you can enter is 99. So if its more than 99, you have to scan it a second time, and do the math manually to calculate the difference. Theres a HUGE line, so I really didn't feel like taking the extra 5 seconds to figure it out. Usually when I do this, I err on the side of caution, and intentionally undercalculate by a couple photos to avoid someone coming back and saying I overcharged them. 

So I scan it once for 99, then a second time for like, 40. (I admit, this was my mistake, but it was the holidays and I was feeling generous. Shouldnt have done that.)

I scan the chapstick, and the coupon. The coupon rejects, because chapstick doesn't qualify as a ""Healthcare item"" I explain that we can't use that coupon, and her husband immediately says, very aggressively:

""I AM A LAWYER. IF YOURE GOING TO MAKE COUPONS LIKE THIS, THEY NEED TO SPECIFY WHAT QUALIFIES AND WHAT DOESNT!"""" BLAH BLAH BLAH. 

I'm like okay, no problem. We'll over ride that for you. 

So I void the transaction, and re-ring it. But this time I take my time to make sure I ring them for exactly the amount of photos they got, I over ride the coupon, and I tell them the total. Which is now like 4 or 5 dollars MORE than their previous one. I explain what I did on the previous transaction, and that I did that because I was in a hurry, but for the sake of accuracy, I've done everything correctly this time. 

They huff a little bit and leave,  and I go on about my day. 

About an hour later,  the wife comes back and says her total doesn't seem right. 

I'm like okay, let's take a look at the receipt. We go over it together. I say ""okay, you got 173 photos. They're 39 cents each."" I punch it into  the calculator,

""That equals XX. Plus your chapstick which was 3.29, minus your 1 dollar coupon. That makes your total XX.""


She says ""HA! But you charged me more than that! See??"" 
She points at her total. 

""Yes ma'am,  thats tax. Which is calculated at .07%""

I enter that into the calculator, and we get the exact amount on her receipt. 

Shes looking really confused, she frowns, and she says

""Hmmm..... that still doesn't SEEM right.""

,TalesFromRetail,"This just happened tonight, so I need to blow off some steam. Sorry if I sound extremely angry or hurtful.

It's around 4:30 this afternoon, my cashier is on his way in 30 minutes so I'm running the register until he gets there. It's a normal Saturday; not too busy, and the customers I do have are buying mainly household items. Nothing too bad.

A few minutes before my cashier shows up, a woman tells me she has two transactions; one for her and one for a friend. Her first transaction was mainly paper products. She paid with a $50 bill, I gave her the change and receipt, she starts the second transaction, and pays with a $10 bill. After the second one, I give her the change and her receipt. I'm making it perfectly CLEAR I gave her the change and receipts.

She walks back in demanding I give her the $14 I owe her from the first transaction. To avoid any fraud, I ask for her receipt. She says I didn't give it to her. I told her it was in her bag, but she outright denies this. I even told her it was in her bag when I was checking her out. Even though I know I'm right, I tell her I can check the garbage can for it. When I can't find it, she demands it back because ""I'm a mother! I work hard for my money, so I know when I don't have the right amount! Where's your manager?! I'm getting my change!"" She's now blocking the line, telling the other customers I'm not giving correct change, and telling people I should be fired for not fitting the customer's needs. My cashier finally shows up, thank God, so I call the store manager to see what I should do. She tells me to go into the back and count down my drawer. If I'm over $14, I'll give her the change and apologize for the situation. If I'm not, have her come in tomorrow so the manager can check the cameras (I've never been shown how). She agrees to wait for me to count my drawer down, assuming she's right.

She's wrong. My drawer IS over...by 86 cents. As I'm walking back to the front, she's following me. I put my drawer back in, ask for the next person in line, and check them out. She's furious. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHERE'S MY MONEY?!"" I tell her my drawer is only over 86 cents, so her change was given correctly. She leaves her cellphone number, says she has company at home, and demands I recount my drawer. After helping my cashier with the line, I take it back to recount. I thought an other transaction or two would change the outcome somehow. Nope. 86 cents.

I call her to let her know there isn't any changes in the amount, so she has to have it somewhere. I apologized a couple of times before saying the thing she can do now is have the cameras checked tomorrow morning. She continues screaming bloody murder and hangs up. I'm currently waiting until tomorrow.

A few things I didn't mention because of post length:
She claimed I took the money. I didn't.
She spoke to my manager on speaker phone.
She claimed to not have the receipt, but showed it as proof.

Yeah, my shift sucked. How was yours?

EDIT: My store manager checked the cameras, and even slowed down the footage to prove I gave her the money/receipt. I did. My manager then told her that she is suspicious of her being a scammer and banned her from the premises due to the fuss she caused.

,TalesFromRetail,"This happened a week or so ago but it's still hilarious to me.

I am assistant manager of a children's stationery shop so over the last few days I've had to deal with some horrendously petty customer complaints but today really topped it.

A few days ago I sold this older woman a pen. A single, ballpoint pen that cost like $1.60. We sell some pretty exciting pens that light up or change colours or have toys on the end, but this one was just a basic ass ballpoint pen with some pink and blue flowers on it or something. The pen is wrapped in plastic and has a sticker on it with the barcode and batch number and store logo and choking hazard and all that normal jazz.

Today she comes in and tells me she got it but the person she was buying for was very upset that it didn't have a ""\[STORE\]s card"" on it (Side note: our store name is singular, eg; fork, but boomers CONSTANTLY pronounce it as a plural, eg; forks, and it drives me absolutely crazy. Anyway.). I didn't quite know what she meant because we don't sell cards with any of our stock - there's no fancy certificate that tells you it's from us or anything like that.

She repeated it and I asked if she meant the barcode because I remembered that I had to look the pen up manually as the label had fallen off it when she purchased it.

She said yes, and apparently, that was a BIG deal. This lady is MAD about this. Apparently, the person who she was shopping for ""knows what she wants"" and was very very upset that she didn't get it with the ""\[STORE\]'s card"" because she wanted to see the name. At this point I pointed out that our store name is printed on the pen itself, so when the label and wrapping is taken off it, you can still see it's from us.

But OH NO that was unacceptable. This woman didn't swear at me, but she may as well have. I explained to her that the barcode label only had a tiny logo, and it was rubbish stuck to other rubbish that you'd have to take off to use the pen. She didn't care! She demanded that it was swapped for another one.

These pens are very old, and most of the labels have been ripped off by kids so I went and grabbed the cup with the others in it a showed her that most of them were missing the labels, including all the pens of that particular colour. A few of the loose labels were in the bottom of the cup. She told me to swap it for another colour, but the other colour was a boys pattern which I'm sure would also be an issue, and at this point, I was absolutely unwilling to take a hit to my KPI's for a return or exchange as petty as this.

After telling her again that the store name was on the pen, and the barcode label would be immediately removed upon use, I suggested I could tape a broken label to it and she agreed. No thanks or anything, of course, just a snarky remark: ""well, it's no skin off your knuckles, you know"" to which I really had to bite back a very rude reply. I sellotaped a random label to it and gave it back to her.

She left, thank goodness.

I have a sneaky suspicion she was referring to our loyalty card - it's like a coffee card where you get stamps for spending and save up to get free things, but you have to spend $15 to get a stamp, not $1.60. If she DARES to come back in and argue that later, I will be very firmly telling her that $1.60 =/= $15 and she will NOT be getting a stamp. The reason I didn't ask about the stamp card is because my first thought was the barcode and she said yes to that, so that's the solution I went with. We shall see if she comes back.

The only thing that consoles me slightly is that she took a significant chunk out of her own day wasting time to come get literally a piece of rubbish off us. Probably spent more on Petrol than she did on the pen.

The pen is wrapped in plastic and has a sticker on it with the barcode and batch number and store logo and choking hazard and all that normal jazz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today she comes in and tells me she got it but the person she was buying for was very upset that it didn&amp;#39;t have a &amp;quot;[STORE]s card&amp;quot; on it (Side note: our store name is singular, eg; fork, but boomers CONSTANTLY pronounce it as a plural, eg; forks, and it drives me absolutely crazy. Anyway.). I didn&amp;#39;t quite know what she meant because we don&amp;#39;t sell cards with any of our stock - there&amp;#39;s no fancy certificate that tells you it&amp;#39;s from us or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She repeated it and I asked if she meant the barcode because I remembered that I had to look the pen up manually as the label had fallen off it when she purchased it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said yes, and apparently, that was a BIG deal. This lady is MAD about this. Apparently, the person who she was shopping for &amp;quot;knows what she wants&amp;quot; and was very very upset that she didn&amp;#39;t get it with the &amp;quot;[STORE]&amp;#39;s card&amp;quot; because she wanted to see the name. At this point I pointed out that our store name is printed on the pen itself, so when the label and wrapping is taken off it, you can still see it&amp;#39;s from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But OH NO that was unacceptable. This woman didn&amp;#39;t swear at me, but she may as well have. I explained to her that the barcode label only had a tiny logo, and it was rubbish stuck to other rubbish that you&amp;#39;d have to take off to use the pen. She didn&amp;#39;t care! She demanded that it was swapped for another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pens are very old, and most of the labels have been ripped off by kids so I went and grabbed the cup with the others in it a showed her that most of them were missing the labels, including all the pens of that particular colour. A few of the loose labels were in the bottom of the cup. She told me to swap it for another colour, but the other colour was a boys pattern which I&amp;#39;m sure would also be an issue, and at this point, I was absolutely unwilling to take a hit to my KPI&amp;#39;s for a return or exchange as petty as this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After telling her again that the store name was on the pen, and the barcode label would be immediately removed upon use, I suggested I could tape a broken label to it and she agreed. No thanks or anything, of course, just a snarky remark: &amp;quot;well, it&amp;#39;s no skin off your knuckles, you know&amp;quot; to which I really had to bite back a very rude reply. I sellotaped a random label to it and gave it back to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She left, thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a sneaky suspicion she was referring to our loyalty card - it&amp;#39;s like a coffee card where you get stamps for spending and save up to get free things, but you have to spend $15 to get a stamp, not $1.60. If she DARES to come back in and argue that later, I will be very firmly telling her that $1.60 =/= $15 and she will NOT be getting a stamp. The reason I didn&amp;#39;t ask about the stamp card is because my first thought was the barcode and she said yes to that, so that&amp;#39;s the solution I went with. We shall see if she comes back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that consoles me slightly is that she took a significant chunk out of her own day wasting time to come get literally a piece of rubbish off us. Probably spent more on Petrol than she did on the pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, Christmas. Brings out the best in everyone, doesn&amp;#39;t it.&lt;/p&gt;

Most customers prefer the gas money since gas prices are expensive where I live, but occasionally I'll find a customer who's willing to go through all the tedious steps of turning their rewards points into a grocery discount. When the discount is transferred onto their card, it automatically comes off the next time the customer uses their card on a purchase.

Anyway, time for the story.

An older man, probably in his 50s, comes through my lane the day after Christmas. He's pleasant, albeit a bit unenthusiastic. Whatever, it's 7 pm, right after a major holiday. He probably just wants to go home. All he's buying is a sandwich from our in-store deli. I go through the whole ""Hi, how are you today?"" script as per usual as I ring up the sandwich, which is $3.29. I ask him if he has a rewards card he would like to use. He does, and I scan it. Then, I hit total.

I stare in confusion at my computer screen. I have dyscalculia (like dyslexia but with numbers), so at first I think I'm just reading all the numbers wrong. But no, the computer definitely says $0.00, and there is a little message on the item list on my screen that says *GROCERY DISCOUNT: -3.29*, so I know I'm not hallucinating. I smile pleasantly at my customer and say, ""You lucky duck! You had some grocery dollars on your card, and you're getting this for free!""

I thought he'd be pleasantly surprised - it's a Christmas miracle! He doesn't have to pay for his sandwich! But no. Instead, he frowns. I don't remember exactly what he said here but he was very unhappy his discount had come off of this purchase. ""Take off the discount,"" he tells me.

I blink. ""What?"" I ask him, trying to retain my customer service voice.

""I wanted to use my $7.00 discount on my grocery order next week. I don't want a discount on this. I want to pay for it.""

He's getting belligerent, and I'm getting nervous. ""I can't take the discount off, sir,"" I tell him, trying to stay pleasant, ""there's no option on my computer for that. It's automatic.""

""Well, how do I get my $3.00 back on my card, then?""

""Well, I can void this whole transaction and start over, and you don't have to scan your card this time, I just have to get my manager over to authorize-""

""I don't want to wait.""

I think fast. I have a lot of options here, but none of them will make him happy. I decide I'll just shove him off on the people at the customer service desk. They'd be able to help him a lot better than I would anyway. ""Here. I'll just go through with this transaction, then you can take your receipt over to customer service, pay for your item there, and get the discount put back onto your card.""

I finish the transaction, he doesn't thank me or say good-bye, and I continue on with my evening. I still don't know if he ever got his discount put back on his card, nor do I know if he ever realized that the $3.29 he got discounted off of that sandwich was the exact same $3.29 he would have not had to spend on a future grocery order. It's the same amount of money, sir.

EDIT: there's a lot of questions in the comments about how the points and the discounts work. Every dollar you spend is one point, every 100 points is 10 cents off per gallon of gas with no upward limit on the number of gallons you can pump, OR $1 off your next grocery order, with no upward limit on the amount of dollars you can get discounted. In order to get the grocery discount on your card you have to download the app or visit the website and convert your points to dollars, then activate the discount on your card like you would with an online-exclusive coupon. Then, just like an online coupon or any other digitally activated discount, it'll automatically come off of your next order as soon as you scan your card. There is no confirmation button for either the cashier or the customer, there's no way for the cashier to know there's a discount on the card until the transaction has been totalled, and there is no way to get rid of the discount once it has been applied. 

I do agree that maybe there should be a pop-up on the cashier's screen in case the customer doesn't want the discount for whatever reason, but also, if the discount comes off on the transaction, that means they've already activated the discount which generally means they want to use it. There are plenty of parameters in place, I think. I don't know - I feel like if there was that much of an issue with the discounts we would have heard complaints and seen changes by now, since the program has been running for a year and a half.

I had walked into a gas station/store where I used to work and talk a friend who still worked there. It was around 9pm and we were talking about all the insane stuff some of the customers would do when an older Asian lady walked in going straight to the counter. L

For the employee I’ll call him Brian, elderly Asian lady will be AL, and since I was observing, I’ll just tell the story as it happened. 

Brian: “Yes ma’am, may I help you?”

AL: (In broken English) “How much scratch off ticket?”

Brian: “$1 each, ma’am.”

AL: “I want 40 please.” She picked the card style she wanted and paid for them in cash. Brian counted out 40 twice to be sure in front of her. 

Brian: “Anything else?”

AL: “No, thank you,” and she got her tickets and went to her car. 

Brian and I were watching her scratch the tickets  in her car and were talking about how it’d be funny if she won a large jackpot and wanted her money now. 

After roughly 20 minutes, AL came back inside with her tickets and walked up to the counter. 

AL: “I want my money back!!!!” and she slammed the now used tickets on the counter. “These no good!!! I want my money back!!!”

Brian looked at me, then to AL and had a surprised look on his face. “Uh, ma’am, I can’t. Once you buy them they’re yours. You can’t bring them back for a refund. They’re yours forever and ever.”

AL gave Brian a look that could kill a bear in it’s tracks, then at me. We really expected her to loudly complain, but she just quietly walked out to her car. Brian and I were examining the tickets and found she had won money, but probably didn’t notice it or understand how they worked. 

As she started backing up, I ran outside to inform her she had money coming and to come back in for her winnings. She almost ran me over before stopping. 

After I told AL she had won some money after all, she got excited, got out of her car, and ran back inside. Meanwhile I put the car in park. Yep, she was that excited. 

Brian explained how the scratch offs worked and showed AL the money she won. It really wasn’t much of a win, though. She paid $40 and walked away with $43. It didn’t matter. She strutted out the door as though she won a million dollars. 

After that I left for home and never saw Brian or AL again.

I was working in a clothing store where we regularly ran a “buy two get one free” on bras. The way our system rang it up was that it took a portion off of each of the bras (example: if each bra was $30, it would take $10 off of each bra). 

One day we had a woman who, because she didn’t see one bra that said $0, was convinced that we were ripping her off. No matter how we tried to explain it, she just wasn’t getting it. Rather than argue with her, my manager rerang the order and did some overrides so that instead of having three $20 bras (total $60) she had a receipt that showed two $30 bras and a free bra (still $60).

The other day, the supermarket I work at had a pipe break and needed the water shut off through the whole store while it was getting fixed.

Anyway, around 9 this dude walks up and says to me ""you're closed??!?!?""

Me: yes unfortunately there was a plumbing issue etc etc, however we can still slice meat/cheese right now and we have boxes of fried chicken :)

Me: ...for what?

Dude (huffy): to tell corporate how you guys are deciding to close early and didn't tell anyone. This is ridiculous

,TalesFromRetail,"So, buying tobacco you need to be 21. We all know this. So you need to have your ID on you when you want to make those purchases. Now I can understand forgetting your ID, I always offer to just keep the item on suspend while the customer runs out and grabs their card so that they don't have to rering everything when they get back.

Well a few days ago this one woman came in. Now, I ask for an ID from anyone who looks under forty and this girl looked like she's around my age in the early-twenties. She asked for three packs of our marlboro 72's and I ask to see her ID.

She just tells me she doesn't have one and rattles off a birthdate. We aren't allowed to accept that, we need to see an actual ID and I explain this to her. She tells me again she doesn't have an ID, as though I'll make an exception because of that. So I'm patient and polite as I tell her that I can't sell the cigerettes to her in that case, and make a subtle reference to the half-a-dozen 'HAVE YOUR ID READY' signs on the doors and register. (They are **everywhere** in this store, it's hard to miss unless you're purposely ignoring them)

Then, and I wish I was joking, she just said ""Well, can't you scan your own ID?""

I've never had someone ask or demand I use my own ID so they can make their purchases. Like, pretty sure that is somewhat illegal, and it's **definitely** something that'd get me fired. I tell her no and bid her adieu.

Not even a minute after she goes out the door some dude comes in and asks for the very same three packs she wanted to buy. We don't have many people buying 72's in my area, like we might sell one or two packs in an evening, so most likely she just sent her friend in to buy them. If a customer is denied a sale because they aren't 21 or don't have a ID, we can't just let someone else buy the thing for them. So I do what we're supposed to do and just ask if he was with the woman who just left, he denies it but it's pretty clear that he is. I don't want to deal with this bs anymore, so I just let him buy them. He has his ID,  our scanner is kind of hit-and-miss at times with IDS so I manually punch in the date when it didn't scan (he was 21 but just barely if I remember right) and he leaves with the cigs.

But, seriously, who the hell asks the clerk if they can scan their own IDs because the customer doesn't have one? I can understand rattling off random 90's dates, that's what the teens here usually do when they're not 21 yet, thinking that actually works, but I've never had someone seriously ask me to use my own ID.",t2_21jo3apr,False,,0,False,"""Can't You Scan Your ID?""",[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,medium,0,,False,t3_kppisb,False,dark,0.99,,public,534,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,534,,False,,1609697760.0,,[],{},,True,,1609726379.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, buying tobacco you need to be 21.

I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with this bs anymore, so I just let him buy them. He has his ID,  our scanner is kind of hit-and-miss at times with IDS so I manually punch in the date when it didn&amp;#39;t scan (he was 21 but just barely if I remember right) and he leaves with the cigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, seriously, who the hell asks the clerk if they can scan their own IDs because the customer doesn&amp;#39;t have one? I can understand rattling off random 90&amp;#39;s dates, that&amp;#39;s what the teens here usually do when they&amp;#39;re not 21 yet, thinking that actually works, but I&amp;#39;ve never had someone seriously ask me to use my own ID.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyways. So an older woman walks into our store. Cashiers are set up to where if there are no customers in line, we are to stand by the front doors to greet customers and supposedly it keeps theft attempts down. The lady walks up to me and says she needs an ""internet cable"", at first I thought she meant an ethernet cable or a phone/router cable.

Lady: No no, not an ethernet cable, an *internet* cable. 

Me: Lemme take you over to that aisle and see if we can find what you're looking for

We go over to the aisle with all the ethernet, router cables and such. Nothing is clicking for her. So I start asking some probing questions to see what the hell kind of cable she could be looking for. It turns out she is looking for a cable box cable. Now here's the problem. Certain internet providers will make you buy specific cables for their routers that my store cannot sell, you have to buy them from your provider. Once I knew what she was looking for, I have to ask what provider she has in order to tell her if we have that specific cable. 

Lady: Ummmm I know what I'm looking for, so I dunno why you're asking me that

Me: If you have either ____ or _____ provider, then that cable is only available through your provider, we do not sell those cables.

Lady: it doesn't matter what I have! Now do you have the cable or not?! 

Me: Ma'm I don't have the information I need to be able to answer that question. Do you have any other information on the cable that might help me find out if we have it? 

Lady: Are you new here or something? All I want is a stupid cable, now do you have it or not? 

Me, just giving up: I don't know, this aisle and the one to your right are where our ethernet and similar cables are, if it isn't here, we likely do not have it.

I turn around to find a little girl looking up at me. She has a look on her face like she has something she wants to ask me but is a little shy. So I kneel down to come to her level.

She cups her hands around my ear and asks me secretly, ""Do you have glass slippers?""

""No I'm sorry I don't have glass slippers,"" I whisper back to her. She ducks under the table and I loose sight of her.

I laugh at myself for a bit, that was a very strange experience. A few minutes later I feel the girl patting my butt again. Before I go down to kneel she quickly points up.

To my surprise, and what do you know. An all clear plastic high heel, kind of like one of those stripper heels. But hey it looked like a glass slipper. So I hand the shoe to her. She ducks under the table and this time I see where she had gone.

,TalesFromRetail,"Well, 2021 is off to a good start; this just happened yesterday- New Year's Day.     I was barely involved, but I'm posting this for Reddit posterity, and to honor my amiga's, amazing act of bitchin' badassery.

First, let me tell you about Lynda; Lynda is more than just a Latina front-line cashier.       Lynda has always aspired to be a 'Loss Prevention' specialist, in anticipation of her someday becoming a full-fledged, street-accredited, police freakin' officer.        So, she often helps out  with store surveillance and plain clothes security; since she's good at it, they're letting her cross-train.

Things were fairly quiet at the big box home improvement store on the first day of the New Year, which was why Lynda was mainly just watching the cameras.        She had her eye on an old regular robber, who had taken up retail theft as a retirement hobby- an old man always got caught, cuz he'd come in with a rolling suitcase *every time,* like nobody would notice, right?        Security would  then let him walk the floor, load up his suit case, then stop him at the door saying, 'Okay, just empty it out and you can go home, sir.        See you tomorrow.'

So natch, Lynda was watching *that* guy, when a shady couple enters the warehouse, who *really* gave off that shoplifter vibe to *everybody*, including me, cuz they were cruising my department with big empty backpacks on.       You can tell when a customer is looking for a tool to suit their needs, and when they're just looking for something expensive to steal.       Thus so, we-all started communicating and coordinating, and observed the couple pick up a set of drills; nonchalantly mosey to the back aisles and suddenly, when they turned a corner, the drills were gone and the male's backpack was stuffed with something coincidently tool-sized.        

  Here's where Lynda heroically sprang into action &lt;cue 'Wonder Woman' theme song from the '70's&gt; - She ran down to the floor and confronted the couple, just like she'd confront the old thief, saying, ""Hey, empty your backpack!       We saw you take those tools, if you give them up; you can get out of here!""

...but nope, the fools underestimated Lynda's small stature and non-uniformed, situational authority and tried to just walk out with the drills brazenly in their bag.    (With a few defiant, choice curse words, edited out here)       What they didn't know was that the plain clothes security officer was shadowing them, too.        They thought Lynda couldn't touch them cuz she wasn't a cop ....well, they thought ***wrong.***       These guys were so down &amp; desperate, they didn't even have a car to escape in, and just hustled to an adjacent train station, where they trapped themselves on the elevated platform.          Lynda chased them up there, where they tried to board an incoming train, and with the help of the Security Officer; she ordered the train to halt in the name of the law, while she called the police.
A whopping seven uniformed cops arrived, including a county sheriff!
I think with the train halted, in conjunction with a robbery; the call may have gone out as a *train robbery*, which was treated as a much more serious offense.
The tweakers attitude improved immensely after that, and they were willing to give up the tools, but it was too late and they were cuffed, booked and taken downtown.

,TalesFromRetail,"Okay so I just got home from work and I had to share this experience I had today. 

So I decided to spend my Christmas break by going to work at the local retail store my mom works at. She got me the job and I have been there multiple times before so nothing was really new to me. My mom has worked there as long as I can remember. She is the kind of employee that knows everything since she's been there for so long. That makes people rely on her if needed. 

So I was just minding my business and doing work as usual when a older man stopped me. I greeted him and I was ready for him to ask me something like where something is or do we have a specific item. So he asks me if we have a specific brand of cleaning rags. Note that I have never even heard of this brand. I wasn't sure but because I always try to help people as best of my ability, I went to the cleaning section and checked. And nope I didn't see anything of that sort. The man kept saying to me how it was a traditional brand and has been around for a long time. He also said that anyone in the business for long enough should know it. Well I kept looking until a another employee walked past me and I asked them to help me a bit. The man repeats his question and the other employee is as clueless as I was. The a third employee shows up and the same thing happens. The third employee says to me if I know where my mom is and I go and her. 

After my mom finally shows up the next conversation happens. 

The man: do you have this specific brand of cleaning rags? 

My mom: unfortunately that has been removed from our store. None of the stores in this area don't carry it anymore. 

The man: why!? 

My mom: unfortunately I can't give you an answer. 

The man: I'm ready to pay for that. Why don't you have it anymore when it has been around for such a long time. I don't want to buy any of this other garbage. Why doesn't any store have good service anymore. 

My mom: if you want to influence the way this store is run you can always leave a review or a complaint. 

The man: THAT'S NOT MY JOB! You should know what the customer want and then provide it for them. 

At this point I left the scene. The man kept complaining to my mom for the next 10 minutes. After the rather interesting 10 minutes the man said thank you and left. My mom just gave me a sigh and a eye roll when she walked past me. 

Later she told me that the man had told her that her mom was a store manager and when something was requested it would arrive immediately. He also told her that he and her wife changed their shopping place because the old one didn't have the ice cream the liked.

So he got his $1 sodas and left. Sorry for the long tale but I’m glad that for now I shouldn’t have any more stories like this.&lt;/p&gt;

What a great way to end the year off with! 

This woman comes up to my register. I greet her like I do with everyone who checks out and have my routine conversation. 

Me: “Are you a card holder with us? 

Her: *Shakes head*

Me: “Would you like to sign up and save 30% when approved?”

Her: *Shakes head*

Me: “Okay, do you know if you have our rewards by any chance though?” 

Her: *Shakes head*

Me: “Can I sign you up? It’s free and you get points?” 

Her: *Shakes head*


I have customers who do this so I was use to them not responding to me when I speak. I continue ringing her out and answer her when she asked(very aggressively might I add) how much the socks cost. 


She then hands me her $50 and we need to check the big bills and then put them in the drawer that only the leads have keys for. 

I get her change but I forgot to put the bill in the drawer so I put her change in the counter next to her and that’s when she lost it. 

Her: “Are you serious? You couldn’t just hand it to me? I handed it to you. Why would you do that.”

Me: “I’m sorry-“

Her: “Who’s your manager? This is ridiculous.” 

My manger was a few feet from me looking for tape. I pointed to her. The customer didn’t need to explain why she was angry because my manger had heard literally everything. 

After she left, my manager just told me that she knew I usually do but to hand the money to the customers. 

What I find so “ridiculous” is that this woman was being rude by not simply saying no to when I was asking her a question and then felt the need to call me rude for putting her money on the counter.

,TalesFromRetail,"This happened a few weeks ago, but the events are still a little fresh and raw in my mind.

I work in quite a small-ish store in the UK, that gets a lot of traffic for mainly local residents.

Being a key-holder, I'm on the list of ""people to call when the alarm goes off"". Normally I miss most calls that come through to my phone due to some shady black spots where I live, but low and behold I get a call at around 4:25am that my store's alarm is going off. They need a person there to ensure that there's nothing wrong. So drag myself out of bed, throw on my work uniform and I'm out the door in under 5 minutes. 

Whilst I'm on the way there I'm on the phone to my GF who's kind of worried with me. We're both pondering what it can be and of course, you're always thinking the worst in your mind. Someone's broken in to steal something, and your just trying get there fast.

I make it there after around 15 minutes of speed-walking and have a look around from outside first, nobody's around. There's no signs that show anyone's forced their way inside. Then I make my way in, phoning the security company to be my second pair of eyes in the roof. I make it in and have a sweep around, making sure everything valuable is where it should be. Then I see the culprit. 

A bag of Cheese Balls just laying on the floor. 

I give my findings to the person over the phone with me and he promptly closes the call out. I then just decide to stay, talk over the phone with my GF off clock with some Tea before the start of my actual shift.

I later showed the camera footage to one of my co-workers on site. When it fell off the shelf and woke up the store's lights, and set the alarm off. We both started laughing.

,TalesFromRetail,"When I first started working at the arts and crafts store back in 2015, this particular event happened my first month in. It was early September and that meant back-to-school shopping was at an all time high, so of course the store was busy. In comes a pregnant woman with a pack of black Sharpies wanting to match the price with Amazon since the difference was by a couple of cents. I didn't know if we did this, being a complete newbie at the time, so I called over the Front End Supervisor (FES) to help.

FES explains that the company doesn't match with online vendor prices. Customer doesn't like this answer and then demands an Assistant Manager. By the time the AM is able to come up front, the line on my register has been getting longer (I was the only cashier for that shift). AM says the exact same thing the FES said: we don't match online vendor prices. Customer then says ""well I was told by one of your workers that you did"", but of course, never said who this supposed employee was. By this time, the other customers in line are getting impatient. They haven't said anything but you could clearly see it on their faces.

Woman demands the store manager. He comes up a few minutes later (as he had been in a conference call), and by this point the customers were glaring daggers at the woman since she still demanded the price adjustment. When the manager tells her the exact same thing, she smugly breaks out into a debate on how it's ""terrible business practice"". Customers in line have had enough, going as far as telling her to either ""buy the damn sharpies or leave"".

Lady slams down the sharpies, pretends to cry and yells ""I'm a 7 month pregnant woman and you people have kept me waiting here long enough! You all should be f-ing ashamed of yourselves!"", before storming off without buying anything. All that for a couple of cents.

**EDIT**: Forgot to mention, at the time I didn't question why the FES, AM and Manager didn't go on registers since it was my first month in. FES couldn't because she doubled as the florist and was in the middle of completing an order for that day. AM simply didn't open registers unless he felt it was absolutely necessary, and I believe that time didn't count for him lol. 

Store manager didn't as he felt it was a good learning experience for me since it would prepare me for the upcoming holiday season. That, and the cashiers for the next shift would be arriving in the next 10 minutes.

,TalesFromRetail,"I used to work as a cashier at an electronics store a few years back and for some reason this interaction popped into my mind so I figured you all might enjoy it. Now just for reference our store on weekends basically was a skeleton crew of 4-6 people so often times I had to deal with customer questions until one of the tech guys or my manager was free. This middle aged man comes up to cash with this printer and tells me it has no price tag on the shelf. So I apologize and tell him I can scan it to check for him. He then makes everyone's favorite jokes about how ""It has no price tag so it's free."" I give him my customer service laugh and let him know that it's about 400$.

Then he tells me that it's actually free because there is no price tag and I explain to him that it doesn't actually work like that. He tells me that because we would change the price if it had the wrong price tag that it having no price tag is equivalent to it having a price tag of 0$ which means that we need to honor our policy and give it to him for free. So again I tell him no I can't give him a printer for free and instead offer him a coupon for 50$ off that I had. Then he starts calling me an airhead or something like that and repeats everything but in a much slower and louder tone like I'm dense.

So I call my manager who is busy with a customer. After a few minutes my manager comes and more or less explains the same thing that I had just said.

,TalesFromRetail," Hello this is my first time posting and am currently on mobile so sorry for formatting! This is going to be a bit of a long one as the whole thing took place over 2 hours.


 I work in the electronics department of a store that has a nickname that sounds like an amusement park name but is nowhere near as fun. A few months back I got a call over the store phone asking if an older woman had come back to see about correcting an issue with her phone. I had yet to see the woman so I responded no and forgot about it until the woman mentioned previously comes up in a riding cart about 20 minutes later. She comes up to the counter and tells me that she came in and purchased a flip phone for one of our prepaid carriers a couple days ago and that it hadn't activated correctly. After asking some basic questions and trouble shooting I figured out the phone had not even gone through the set up process to get a number and set up service.


She starts looking at other phones for a bit before coming back and asking me about some of the smart phones. She makes it quite clear that she has Lyme disease and just wanted a basic simple phone. She had seen the Samsung A01 on the postpaid table and had been considering that but put emphasis on that she didn't care for smart phones. After she finished talking for a moment and I could finally say something around her running in circles, I offered to activate the flip phone she bought previously to save her the hassle of returning the phone, buying a different one, and figuring out a smart phone. The phone she had was what she wanted all I had to do was get it set up. She gave me the go ahead to set up the flip phone and that's what I did. It took me about 5 minutes to get it set up and I even wrote down the number on a slip of paper and taped it to the back of the phone as well as entering it in her contacts under 'My Number' so she knew it was hers.


Finishing up the process she seemed happy with the fact it was working and she went off on her way. This whole exchange took about 30 or 40 minutes in and of it's own but it was worth it to fix her problem. I was alone for the rest of the night, I work closing shift, and my department was dead. I got back to zoning and working freight and after about 10 minutes I get a call on the store phone from service desk asking about this same lady missing a phone she was trying to return.


Now this confused me as we had gone through what we did so she wouldn't have to go through the hassle of a return. I explained what had happened to service desk and they said okay and hung up. Well apparently the lady started to kick up a fuss about her missing a phone she never bought and a CSM came back looking for the receipt or phone in question. I once again explained what happened and they went back up to try to sort out the womans confusion.

10 more minutes pass and the woman is back at my counter accusing me of stealing her new smart phone that she never bought. I told her that she didn't buy a new phone, that I had activated the one she already had but she was insistent on the fact she bought a new phone. Now this is where the Lyme disease as mentioned comes in as it can affect or fog up memories. She even said that while she may have Lyme disease her mind wasn't that far gone and I had to hold my tongue.

She's getting more and more aggressive over this phone she never purchased swearing I stole it and asking if I felt proud of myself stealing from a poor older woman. At this point I'm trying to get a manager back here because she just will not calm down or listen to reason. My anxiety is rising and I'm starting to fall over the edge into a panic attack as I feel my eyes stinging, I don't do well with hostility. Finally a manager comes back and the woman starts going off again about how I stole her phone. They get my side after she finished and once I'm done they tell her that with there being no receipt or anything to show she had bought a new phone and with me being the only electronics assosciate in the store and saying I made no phone sale to her that there was no way for her to get the A01 she swears she bought.


That didn't sit well with her as she turns on management now saying how they were a fraud and against her, that she was going to get the cops involved and they'd be sorry. The manager told her she was more than welcome to call the cops and they could come in and check the cameras to see what happened but otherwise nothing could be done for a non existant sale. The woman finally leaves and goes to the parking spot to find the person who gave her a ride to the store. Now at this point it has been almost two hours since I got the initial call asking if I had seen this woman. After about 20 more minutes I go to clock out and run into one of the CSMs and ask what happened after. Apparently she got to the parking lot and realised her ride was gone and started to freak out even more. It got to the point she called an ambulance to come give her a ride. She never did come back with cops.


TLDR: Woman comes to electronics with a phone issue and considers swapping phones. I fix it for her to save the hassle, forgets what happened and accuses me of stealing a phone she never bought after service desk reminds her after talking to me about what happened and leaves in ambulance after she realises she has no ride home.",t2_49en2ioh,False,,0,False,Elderly Woman Thinks I Stole Her Phone,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,epic,0,,False,t3_km2cdz,False,dark,0.96,,public,94,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Epic,False,94,,False,,1609267904.0,,[],{},,True,,1609228820.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello this is my first time posting and am currently on mobile so sorry for formatting!

Background:
I worked at a big box retailer for 6 years with 3 of those years being a front-end supervisor, that means being over the cashiers, the parking lot, the cleaning crew, and some of the overall returns from other departments. In this particular case, it was a battery return that required approval because the automotive manager was out at the time.

It was a fairly busy day and we got a call for battery return approval. I call out saying I got it and make my way to automotive. Normally on a return like this it’s a couple of key turns, no big deal. 

When I get there, I notice something off right away. There’s 2 guys  waiting on the battery exchange, Adam and Bill, not their real names. Even though Adam provided his ID per the return policy, Bill does all the talking. Bill says when I get there, that their truck is dead on the side of the road and they need an exchange. Ok no problem right? 

Then I look at the battery they brought in, part of the printed serial number was scratched off and so was part of the barcode attached to the serial number, and the little manufacturer’s sticker that verifies the date it was made had the telltale marks of being lifted up. This is a problem because we have no way of verifying when the battery sold and the little date sticker could also not have been original to the battery. Also the battery looked way too dirty for the age it was supposed to be. I told Adam and Bill that I wouldn’t exchange the battery due to the fact I can’t verify date of purchase. 

Bill kicked up a fuss about I’m leaving them stranded and all I could do was explain that I was going by policy and without verification I would not do an exchange.

For the first receipt, she returned two items, with a total refund amount of $18. The second receipt had 14 items and a total refund of about $250.

After I processed the first transaction and issued her a receipt, she expressed confusion over the low amount. I said, “Yeah, I could see how that might be confusing. It’s only $18 because only two of these items are from that transaction. After I finish this second transaction you’ll have your full refund and it’ll be a lot higher.”

As it turns out, that wasn’t her point of confusion. 

Her: The original receipt says I spent $74. Why am I only getting 18 back?

Me: In the original sale, you bought many items. In the transaction I just did, you only returned two of those items. 

Her: if I spent $74, I should be getting $74 back.

Me: if you were to return every single item from the original sale, then yes, you would get all $74 back. But you only returned $18 worth of merchandise from this receipt, so you’re getting an $18 refund.

At this point, I was finishing up the second transaction, and desperately hoped this would clear things up.

Me: Alright, so your second refund is going to be $250 (I’m paraphrasing here, I don’t remember the exact amount). So you returned $18 from the first receipt and $250 from the second one, and those two quantities equal the value of all of these items here (*I’m gesturing towards the many returned items surrounding me*)

Her: This still doesn’t make sense. Looking at these receipts, my first refund should be $74 and my second refund should be $260.

Me: If you were to return every single item you bought in both of these transactions, then you’d be right about that. But I can only issue refunds for the items you return.

This went in circles for awhile. I ended up having to show her where each returned item was on the original sales receipt, and count the number of items she returned and the number of items she originally bought. When she finally understood (or gave up), did she apologize for holding up the line? Nope. Did she thank me for patiently explaining the concept of returns to her twelve thousand times without losing it? Of course not.

,TalesFromRetail,"So this was some years ago (I don’t remember how many but it was in the past 6 years).

Back when I worked in the department store, I worked in the men’s department. I was at the register ringing people up when a man and his wife came up and asked for help picking clothes out. My co-worker did not have a customer so she volunteered to help him. They walked around chatting and laughing and picking out outfits for the guy to try on. He goes to the changing room to try the stuff on and coworker and his wife chat while they wait. I’m hanging out at the register doing nothing when the guy comes back from the fitting room. Coworker and his wife are standing in the section right in front of the register so I get a full view of everything that has been happening. The guy goes back to coworker and says he likes the clothes and wants to pick out more so they all continue shopping. He has his back to me and that is when I see his untucked shirt has caught on something in the back of his pants. It was a gun. He had a gun tucked into the back of his pants and when he changed back into his clothes he had not made sure his shirt was covering it. 

A lot of thoughts went through my mind and most of them were dumb. I think I was in a state of dumb shock. I thought:

‘I need to call security and tell them a guy has a gun’

‘What would security do? They don’t have guns. Plus I don’t want to cause false alarms, he is calm and non-threatening’

‘Maybe he is an undercover cop and that is why he has a gun. Do cops carry guns in the back of their pants? Do they make holsters for the butt-crack?’

‘I don’t know the laws for my state about open carry or concealed carry? Maybe it’s legal for him to have a gun? But I thought the mall rules said no guns?’

,TalesFromRetail,"This is gonna be a long one (summary of TLD something)  Karen wants one color in an amount that 6 states of stores has. The shade is off. Can't gets what she wants. 

STORY::

Working at the red store with an M, I was a customer experience person so I had my fair share of Karens...  I was also an expert on the yarn...

Now what you have to realize is that when they manufacture yarn, it is dyed  and these are cut up into skeins and these are called dye lots.  When packaged by 3 skeins per pack, they get thrown into huge bins.  Because they are all the ""same color"", the dye lots get mixed up.   The only way to even try to guarantee is to call the Redheart and order a special run and even then the beginning and ends of the runs very because of how much dye is in the vat.

Did you know that little old ladies can spot a shade difference in the yarn from 50 paces??  But only after they have taken every freakin' skein out of there place on the shelf??

This woman comes in and needs 50 skeins of offwhite lionheart 5 weight yarn for a project she is working on.  We all know that this will not end well.

In order for me to get that many (as we only carry about 9 skeins max at a time (with up to 6 weeks to get more), I smile and tell Karen that of course we can do that but it will take 4 to 5 weeks or so for us to get them.  

""They must be the same dye lot!""   I inform her that their is very little chance of that happening and tell her why and we will do what we can.  I repeated in our conversation that it was going to be near impossible but we will do what we can. ""That's fine""

To accomplish the gathering, I would spend 4 hours over the next week contacting every store in our district (13 covering Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota) and having them send what they can 3-6 skeins so they wouldn't wipe out 3 states worth of inventory).  So this is all coming in on the stores UPS dime but it is something we eat as the cost of doing business on a daily basis.  It takes that long for me to get things rolling as I have to take time out of helping customers, call that store, talk to someone on their sales floor, they have to go check their shelf (all while helping their customers), and then come back and tell me how many (if any) they have and get the paperwork done.  The shipping maybe 2 weeks if they have it.  

So, she calls in weekly to see if we have them yet.  She hangs up with a huff when we don't.  But I do let her know a running total and remind her that they may not be the same dye lot.

So after almost two months, we get them in and I call her.  It takes another couple of days for her to come in.  Remember - she can't pay in advance unless she orders online.

She comes in. I go to the back. I get the two large mini-fridge size boxes we had been collecting the yarn in.  We begin to go through them.  the screeching begin.

""THESE AREN'T THE SAME NUMBER!!""

I look and low and behold, about half are the same lot number.  And the rest are two different lot numbers.  I swear to the gods that, no joke, I held them up to a lighted magnifying glass and could NOT tell a difference between them.

She screeches at me as I am trying to tell her this is the best we could do and that I had told her this was gonna happen.  SCREECHES FOR A MANAGER!!!!  (couldn't you predict that).

Now I have to tell you.  My manager was a bitch.  With a capital B.  Was told that to her face by employees and customers alike on a bi-weekly basis.  We still never figured how SHE wasn't fired.  But she made the store and the district massive money so we figure that is why.  And she was a queen of give no fu\*\*s.

Karen goes on about me and how I hadn't told her that she would be getting different colors.  I was worthless.  I wasted her time. yada yada.

Finally, she winds down.  Manager turns to me.  I explain what happened.  ""So you spent how much time getting these in?"" in a nice tone.

She turns to Karen.  ""Ma'am, OP spent x time finding even this many.  The only way to get any more of ANY Lot Number is to start calling around the country and I don't have time for him to waste on what is GOING to be a needle in a haystack.  Do you want to purchase the yarn or not?""

I am standing there floored. Slack jawed Karen and her quiet husband are standing there, and she swoops 31 skeins (some stores only had loose skeins) into her cart and stomps off to the register.

Manager just looks at me.  I'm like ""Yep!"" and I slide the rest of the yarn back in to the box and take 30+ skeins of overstock to the shelves over the yarn to pull from when we restock for the next 4 months.

\*\*\*side note for all those who shop yarn.  We don't mind if you pull all the skeins out of the cubby on the shelf to check the dye lots.  But we would appreciate it if you would stuff them back on the shelf in the right cubby.

,TalesFromRetail,"Some background before we begin. I am a huge car enthusiast whose very proud of my family heritage (mainly French and Italian) and have been to Europe a few times to be familiar with the cars there. That said, lets begin.

It's about 2015ish, and I'm at work at my local outlet mall working at a higher end audio brand. It's a mall that sees a TON of both local and international traffic, as there is an international airport about 10 miles away with busses that run direct to it from the airport - kinda legit when you think about it.

We just started selling a brand new Bluetooth speaker that had plenty of hype behind it and was becoming quite popular as we were entering the summer months because of its loudness and outdoor usability. Enter Air Force Vet (now called AFV)

Me: Hi, welcome to the XXXX store, how can i help you?

AFV: well... I have an odd request.

Me: What do you need? (heard this line before, or so i thought)

AFV: Well... i need to take a product outside. you have a floor model i can take?

Me, mildly startled: What do you mean outside? Our products can't leave our sales floor.

This gets the attention of my Store Manager, who now has his head turned to listen in on the conversation

AFV: Well, i need to see if something fits... its a tight space...

Mind you, this gentleman is older, maybe mid 50's into early 60's. From his demeanor, i could tell that even he knew this was highly irregular to ask to take a product out of the store floor without purchasing, but I could also tell he was an honest sort of guy.

SM (store manager): (walking over) what are you trying to do sir?

AFV: I heard about this new speaker of yours and wanted to see if it fit in a space in my car. it doesn't have a stereo, and this speaker looks like it could fit perfectly in this space.

Now my manager knows my affinity for cars, so when i looked at him knowingly and longingly, he gave the approval to go outside with the product and was basically told to guard the unit with my life. As we walked out to the guys car, we started talking back and forth.

Turns out, he is an AFV from serving for nearly 20yrs at airbases in Germany and Italy. He served during the 70's-90's and lived there for a small while with his wife in Italy. They returned only recently and decided to bring his beloved car back from Italy with him.

The Car? A beautiful all original 1970's Fiat 500 in a glorious 2 tone red on black. It had been refitted with a power outlet to run a small fan (car was never built with AC or anything powered) with the original leather top as the only other source of fresh air. And it was tiny!

After discussing the car, we promptly looked in the center. Low and behold, the ""space"" was a near exact fit, with a power outlet to charge the speaker with right there. Car never had a radio in it to begin with, so this would be a huge upgrade over the deafening sound of tiny Italian engine noises.

We give it a test right there in the lot in the car. AFV was relatively satisfied, but after all the excitement over seeing and being in this car, I wanted to seal the sale. I convinced him to start the car ( at this point we were pretty chummy) so we could test the speaker with the native car sounds and see if the speaker could outdo the noise. Then, HE gets really committed. ""buckle in, lets go for a ride""

Without question, I buckled in. Next thing I know, we are now scooting around the massive parking lot of my outlet mall doing nearly 40-50mph (the top speed of the Fiat) blasting the Eagles at full volume without any issues hearing the music. I'm having a blast, loving every second of not only chilling with this incredibly nice gentleman, but also getting PAID to be in this car with AFV.

About 10 minutes of racecar noises and receipts later, he bought not only the speaker, but every optional item we had for it, minus a car charger since he had the power outlet already in his car.

So me and my friend work at a grocery store. She would open the self checkout on the weekends, and sometimes I would open the regular registers. The morning this first started I wasn’t opening with her, I found out the story later when a whole bunch of other stuff went down. But basically what had happened was this man came into the self checkout with a single banana and asked my friend to scan it and weight it for him. She explained that her register didn’t have a scale on it, and that he would have to scan and weight it himself of one of the self checkout machines. (Let me remind you, that there was a regular register open at this time, there may have been a line, but he wasn’t forced to used the self check out if he didn’t want to) He then got super angry, and was saying how it wasn’t his job, it was hers, and that she was going to do it for him, or she was going to get her manager and he was going to have her fired. So my friend called over the manger, and the manager told him the same thing. And so the man leaves, but that’s not where the story ends. The next weekend I’m opening with her, and I see this man come in, and walk through the self checkout, and to the back of the store. She comes over and explains who he is to me, then we see him in the back talking to other customers, looking back at her and pointing, presumably he was talking shit about her. He then comes back with my store manager, demanding that he fire her for not weighing his banana LAST WEEKEND. He got in her face, and I’m pretty sure he actually touched her. Which our managers banned him from the store for doing so. Apparently he had also been coming in all of that week to try and get her fired, what he didn’t know is she only worked weekends. Last I heard he’s apparently been banned from multiple stores in the area for doing similar things, and I just can’t help but wonder where he shops now.

,TalesFromRetail,"I am new to the retail world of the department stores and I was at a register currently ringing another customer for their items. During that transition, two ladies with a stroller were browsing some items on a display and tried to ask for the price of the items while I was ringing my current customer for their items. I asked them if they could wait until I finished with the transaction before I could give them an answer. They showed facial expressions that were certainly displeased and even someone like me who has high function autism (I have a hard time recognizing facial, vocal tone, or body language expressions of people's feelings or mood) could recognize instantly they were going to be troublesome. 

After I was finished with my customer, the two ladies came up to ask me to help them with a return. Unfortunately, the item in question had multiple return labels which made the transaction to return their item difficult and caused errors in the system. Looking at their item, I noticed it for another brand that has their own section in the store and asked them to visit their counter to get their item properly taken care of as I wasn't able to continue the transaction. 

The customer got much angrier as they did not want to wait in another line to get a return, but I told them I am unable to do the return as it was a brand item for a specific section. Both ladies got very angry yelling profanities and one of the ladies said she once worked for the company and knows how we do things and that I was incompetent and lazy and I should do my job. I almost lost my temper, but I firmly told her I couldn't help her as it was not part of my area in the department (Also I was a new hire for a month so I am limited in knowledge and training being thrown into the holiday seasonal hire). She demanded my manager which I tried but being in an area of the store where cell reception doesn't work I couldn't make a call to my manager. I was also too far from other employees to get help. During this time she and her companion were yelling additional profanities and name-calling while waiting.

At that point, I was starting to get more worked up and just trying to get them to go away. I attempted to walk away ( I have the right to refuse service if I felt in danger) as they kept bombarding me with insults, but they positioned themselves in a way where every direction I went they went to stand in front of me. 

Finally, another employee who was more knowledgeable than me happen to pass by and the woman's attention turned to grab that other employee who could possibly do better than me an incompetent employee. I was trembling due to an anxiety attack coming up and the lady and her friend continued to make fun of me trembling and additional insults as my fellow coworker was problem-shooting the issue. Apparently, it was a situation that needs to be overridden by a full-time employee or manager. I found an opportunity to leave and politely excuse myself before going to the staff breakroom to breakdown. 

For an experience that lasted about 10 minutes, it left a deep impression on me and I still get worked up from it.

He brought in one of our shopping bags containing a broken juice glass (a small drinking cup) which had chipped in his dishwasher. This happens, and I was trying to figure out which set it was from while we argued about whether his replacement should be free. He figured, ""The sign says it's dishwasher safe. It broke in the dishwasher."" I tried to explain that dishwashers have boiling water and extreme dry heating and that all glass is unaffected by those conditions, making it dishwasher safe. If it bangs around due to over-filling, that's on him. He insisted it means that the glass cannot be broken while in a dishwasher.

After chatting for a while, I finally realized we didn't have any sets that matched his glass. It also didn't look familiar, and I had gotten my start in the glass department 3 years earlier. He admitted he had owned the glass for at least 3 years. We still kept a limited quantity of discontinued pieces, so I started asking some of the veteran salespeople if they recognized the design. None of them did. This man admitted that he had owned his glass for over a decade. He still felt that we owed him a replacement, as he had apparently not already had his money's worth.

On a hunch, I checked our competitors' websites, and found his glass at Pottery Barn. I told him if he brought it to one of their stores, they would likely replace it for him. By this time, the man was getting really frustrated. He kept talking about how we were obligated to replace the glass due to our false advertising claiming glass is dishwasher safe. Using very small words, I explained that we did not sell that glass and never had.

He said that he would accept another glass of a similar shape and size. I showed him the Pottery Barn page for his glass, but he insisted it was from our store. He did not have a receipt or the credit card which he used for the original purchase. He just wanted a small glass for free in exchange for his broken glass. I apologized and refused, explaining as politely as I could that he was being totally unreasonable.

He left in a huff and complained to corporate. They called the store and told us to give him a $25 gift card to make it up to him - he was coming back that afternoon. My boss and I discussed it and decided to offer him one free juice glass instead, his choice. He picked out a glass which retailed for $1.25. We took his broken glass in exchange.

I work at a dollar store that also happens to be the only grocery store in my small rural town. Most of our customers are regulars who live nearby, and I have a friendly relationship with many of them. About a month ago, our managers called a staff meeting and explained that we had to start getting stricter about carding people for tobacco. We have to ask to see a physical ID every time we sell tobacco products, even if the person is a regular who comes in every day and is clearly elderly. We also have to see the IDs of every person in the shopping party who looks to be older than 15, meaning parents can’t buy cigarettes with their older teenage kids in tow. I think the rule is stupid, but I follow it because my managers emphasized how important it was, and how we could lose our jobs if we didn’t. I usually tell parents with teenage kids that they can finish their transaction, go put their groceries and kids in the car, and come back inside to buy cigarettes. Most people are annoyed about this, but accept it. 

The other day I got two older men I’d never seen before come in to buy snacks. One of them wanted cigarettes. As per policy, I asked to see both their IDs. They argued with me for a bit about it, because the guy who wasn’t buying them didn’t have his, and they were both clearly over 60. OM1 is the old man who wants cigs and has his ID, OM2 is the man who doesn’t have an ID, me is me. 

OM1: I don’t understand why you’re being like this, I can’t accept that you’re too dumb to tell that I’m over 21.

Me: I know, right? I can’t believe they’re making me enforce such a pointless rule. Trust me, I’d love to sell you your cigarettes, but I don’t want to risk my job and they’ve been tough on us lately. 

OM1: Well, I ain’t leaving without my cigarettes. 
Me: It’s not in my power to make that call. Let me get you my manager to speak to. 

OM1: Yeah, get your manager, maybe he’ll have some common sense. 

So I get my store manager and explain the situation. He tries to explain the policy to the guys, but they keep escalating it and they’re starting to yell, so he backtracks and tells me to just give them the cigarettes. At this point I was kind of relieved because I thought it would shut them up. I was wrong. 

Me (scanning the cigs) I’m sorry about all that, sir.

OM1: No you’re not. Don’t act like you’re sorry. You’re just mad the manager wouldn’t let you get away with it. 

Me: (at this point I’m just in customer service robot mode) I’m glad you got your cigarettes! I hope you found everything else you need today! 

OM1: How old are you! How old are you?
Me: I’m 23.

OM1: I’m old enough to be your grandfather. And you could see that for yourself if you’d just open your damn eyes and have some common sense. Do you even know what that means? I come from a generation where a thing called “common sense” ran the world, but I don’t think young people even know what that means anymore.

OM2: Be careful, you’re going to offend him! Young people get so offended when you talk about common sense! 

They both had a good laugh about that, and I forced a smile, and very politely bagged their items, and wished them a nice day, and then locked myself in the bathroom to practice breathing exercises until I no longer had the urge to jump over the counter and fight an old man. The sad thing is, I would have just suggested that the guy with the ID get back in line without his friend to buy them if he hadn’t been so damn rude to me.

I was the front end opener one morning, and during the process of counting/reconciling the tills from the day before, I noticed the second pharmacy drawer wasn't in the safe. This was weird, but not alarmingly weird, as it had occasionally been left in the pharmacy overnight (and obviously that gets locked up tight, so no real worry on that front) and I figured that was what had happened this time.


Well, the pharmacist came in (the pharmacy manager in this case) and I handed her the one till and said, ""I think they left the other in the pharmacy last night--"" and before I finished she gave me a weird look and said, no, she was the closer last night, she brought it up and handed it directly to our store director.


Baffled, I wondered where on earth he could have possibly put it, and started checking cabinets behind the desk. Lo and behold, in the third one, I found the missing till. Bear in mind, this was not a locked cabinet. We also stored everyday tools in there, so it was definitely opened a lot.


I quickly counted the till, handed it over, and then, amused as hell, grabbed refunds to go find him in his office, since they had to be signed anyway and I was so not missing the chance to give him shit for this. (The best thing about this store director was that he was very much in favor of good-natured ribbing. At one point during the time we worked together, I told him he was a troll. He didn’t know what that meant, not being terribly internet savvy, but after I explained he looked at me and nodded. “Yeah. That’s fair.”)


When I got to his office, I handed over the refunds, he signed them, we chatted amiably, and then I said, ""So I found the pharmacy till in an interesting place this morning..."" and the look on his face immediately changed from its normal placidity to *oh fuck*.


Apparently they had been so slammed and understaffed the night before that he was up front helping out for a good chunk of time, and in a hurry, he just stashed it (hidden, at least) and intended to come back to it later, but completely forgot.

One of her purchases was a dress of a famous Disney character ( Moana )

Then at the moment I duck / bent down to grab a bag from the drawer, she blew up on me!

Why? She screamed and taught that ""I'm going to grab her dress, throw it on the floor, and step on it to ruin it on purpose"".

I told her that no, I'm just grabbing a bag to put her purchase in.

She didn't want that cause "" the dress will get wrinkled ""

* Suggestion 1 :So I suggested a T-shirt box, we could fold it nicely and give it to her in the box, she said no cause it wouldn't fit in her luggage.
* Suggestion 2: I asked if she wants it wrapped in plastic, nice and firm, and she can take it like that.She got mad at me, cause "" I taught that you guys are eco-friendly people / love animals"", and refused this one aswell.
* Suggestion 3: I suggested another thing that we usually use to protect fragile stuff. it has 2 portions, one its white paper, and the other its like carton but its cut in a fish-net like pattern, So I gave an idea to wrap this like a treasure / gift from the ocean ( somewhat ). She denied this one as well since for her it look ugly.
* Suggestion 4 : I asked when do they need the dress for ( it was a week (more or less) before Halloween, she said she needed by the day after tomorrow (so shipping it wasn't an option either).
* Suggestion 5: I suggested to let me check if we have one brand new from the box in its original packaging in the back ( same size and all ) , but this triggered her off.... why? She said that I ""somehow"" knew that her granddaughter had asthma, and by giving her an item that could have dust on it, its because I wanted to maliciously hurt / kill her. She went on a full tirade on me.

Luckily my manager and supervisor were witness to the whole ordeal.

My supervisor intervened first and tried to call the woman down, the woman when off on how ""disrespectful , insultive, rude, ect"" I was, called me all kinds of names, and still my supervisor was trying to help but no avail while the lady was getting more and more aggressive.

Not even her husband who was next to her the whole time, tried to calm her and said lets go please, he did nothing wrong, (he had the look of why, please stop).

Then... my manager stepped in, and she is the BOSS, with no mercy, she just grabbed a bag from another register, took the dress, shoved it into bag, folded the top of the bag, stapled it shut , along with the receipt, and with a smile that says,"" I'll kill you"", and said : ""Have a good day :) "".

The lady got mad and was about to blow up on my manager, but my manager shut her down by saying:

"" Leave now or security will be called :) ""

After that, the lady just grabbed her stuff and ran, following behind the tired / defeated husband.

After she left, I was told to get a break to calm down / recover from this incident.

I scanned everything for her order and gave her the total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her purchases was a dress of a famous Disney character ( Moana )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at the moment I duck / bent down to grab a bag from the drawer, she blew up on me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? She screamed and taught that &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to grab her dress, throw it on the floor, and step on it to ruin it on purpose&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her that no, I&amp;#39;m just grabbing a bag to put her purchase in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She didn&amp;#39;t want that cause &amp;quot; the dress will get wrinkled &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Most people.

I was sitting in the bathroom enjoying quiet time for the first time all morning

I forwarded the shop phone to my cell so there wasn't any connection issues since the bathroom is in the back of the building.

I'm sitting there, chillaxin, checking out some dank memes, when the phone starts ringing and my eyes roll back into my head so hard I can see myself in 10 years.

I answer the phone.

""Locksmith"", I mutter professionally.

""Yeah, I was just wanting to know how much it costs to get a key made"", the voice on the line says, seemingly a woman in her mid 30s. I could hear the haircut in her voice, and you know exactly which one I mean.

""Well that depends, what kind of key?"" I reply.

""It's metal with plastic on the top of it."", says the female.

My eyes, unable to roll back any further, give up and close.

""Okay, and what does it go to?"", I ask, slightly annoyed.

""My car"", the woman says vaguely.

At this point, I no longer have any desire to enjoy my porcelain throne time, paid or otherwise. I cross my arms and legs, and continue my line of questioning.

""And what kind of car do you have?"" I ask, praying to every god under and over the sun that she will give me a solid answer. 

""A Chrysler"" she says, knowing exactly how much she's making me want to speak to her manager.

""And what model?"" I squeak.

""300"" she answers, like a bad tinder conversation.

At this point, I can feel myself slowly sliding off the seat, but I don't have the strength to stop myself. I ask the next question, but this time, I'm smart. I ask two questions.

""What year is that? And did that have buttons on it or was it a plain key?""

Thinking I outsmarted the wench, I confidently await her answer.

""It's a 2005. What was the other question?""

I try my best to stop myself from hanging up, and I repeat my question.

""Oh it's the button one""

I breathe a sigh of relief, thinking the pain is over, before my eyes snap open and I realize the horror that there's another question to ask.

""And where is the car?"" I ask, thinking that all along she had lost her key, and needs a replacement.

""At my house"", she replies, as I feel my blood start to boil in my veins, my hearing starts to fade and my vision blurs.

""Is that in *city we're in*?"", I ask, clawing at the vein bulging from my temple.

""Yeah""

Finally, the end of the questions. I'm free.

""Okay, then it'll be about $180 for the key, programming, trip out to you, and everything else that needs to be done."", I tell her.

She screeches in my ear, ""WHAT? Why is it so much? I had you guys make a copy a few months ago and it was only $85, I have the receipt!"", causing my brain to go into fight or flight mode, and making me very glad I was on the toilet in that moment.

When I collect myself and realize what she said, I feel a wave of anger unlike anything I've felt before.

""So you didn't lose your keys, you just need to know how much for a copy?""

""Yes""

""And you had a receipt this whole time telling you exactly how much that costs?""

""Yes""

In this moment, all I wanted to do was remove my single bluetooth earbud, lower it between my legs, and release the most ungodly noise upon her ears. But unfortunately, I took the moral high ground, and simply replied, ""Yes, 85 is the price for just the key"".

,TalesFromRetail,"First post, but this should fit the sub.

I’ve seen a lot of stupid things in my 40+ years of customer service, but this one has to be top three at worst.  It was roughly 2005, and I was working the overnight shift at my local (largest convenience store chain in the world).  The police dropped by to advise me that a competitor about a mile away had been robbed some two hours earlier and the attendant pistol-whipped (perpetrators hit her with a handgun while robbing the place).  I knew this attendant, maybe 5’0” on a good day and 105 pounds soaking wet, there would not have been any need to treat her like that, so I was eager to help if possible.  The police officer was able to give me a description of the persons of interest including what they were wearing, and asked me to call if I saw anything that could help.

Later that night (some five hours after the robbery) a car pulled up and a young man jumped out to use the pay phone in front of the store (remember, this was 2005, pay phones were still a thing then).  Normally I wouldn’t have thought twice about it except that the clothes this kid (16-17 years old or so) was wearing matched the description of the clothing of one of the robbers, so I called police dispatch, advised them of what I had seen, and the direction the car went when they exited the parking lot.  Not thirty seconds later, a police car went flying by in the direction the suspect’s car had gone, full light bar going but no siren as it was about three in the morning.

I learned from the police later that morning that they caught up to the car about four blocks away from my store, and the occupants of the car were the robbers.  How did they know?  Not only did the robbers not stay at home and go into hiding, not only were they using the same car and wearing the same clothes, but they had the money from the robbery in PLAIN SIGHT in the front seat of the car.
Like I said in the title, STUPID robbers.  I got a community service commendation from the police department, and the robbers got an all-expenses-paid trip to the state prison for aggravated robbery and aggravated assault.

We have signs posted at the top and bottom asking people not to do this but still every day you see someone taking their cart and having this surprised look on their face when they almost fall or their cart almost tips over.

Another thing is they get angry when you tell them their not allowed to. We've had customers call to file a complaint saying an employee told them they couldn't take their cart up on the escalator. They'll be like they were rude about it. I understand no one wants to be talked to in a rude way but if an employee raises their voice or seems rude in a situation like that its because they're trying to get your attention and express how dangerous what your doing is. Especially since we've had several incidents of people falling and then getting mad at us when they're told we can't be held responsible because we have signs posted.

The first time we see the person in question, he was grabbing a tray and heading over to the soup bar. I remember distinctly that he was wearing a very bright, memorable Hawaiian shirt.  I was working the register, so I had a pretty good vantage point of most of the area customers would be, which makes it easier to keep an eye on everyone and everything.

The man came up with his tray of soup, staring straight ahead. Worried he would pass me and forget to pay, I said in my winning customer service voice, ""Hello, sir!"" He kept walking. ""Sir, you have to pay for that!"" Still no response, and he didn't even speed up his walk. ""Sir! Sir!"" Being a woman on the short side, there was no way for me to stop him, so I picked up the phone and dialed security.

The man decided to walk out into our courtyard, which just so happened to not double as an exit. Security came to me, asked me about what had happened, then went to go talk to the individual. He ended up being escorted off the premises, and we thought that was that. Just a very bold thief. But no, it couldn't stop there.

It was a slow day, so hours later, I was chatting with a coworker, me behind my counter, my coworker on the other side. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a very familiar Hawaiian shirt. The thief had returned. Now, for me personally, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I didn't say anything at first, but I did keep half an eye on him while I chatted with my work friend. On the complete other side of the room from where I was (Trust me, huge room), I saw the man pick up a bag of chips and stuff them in his shirt.

I was pretty ticked off, so before I could think, hesitate, or finish the sentence I was on in my conversation, Big Sister Voice came out, and I yelled in a voice that is often used to frighten people bigger than me, ""SIR! PUT THOSE CHIPS BACK RIGHT NOW!"" My coworker was frozen in place with surprise and confusion, and the man's eyes were huge. There was silence for a few moments as I did my best to keep up the stern expression I had. He walked over to me and it was suddenly very obvious how much smaller I was. Without saying a word, he took the chips out of his shirt, laid them down on the counter in front of me, and trudged away.

A little info before getting to the main story. A guy bought 2 studio monitors and as a gift we included the audio cables for free. I personally informed him that the extra cables will be placed in one of the boxes.

So after 2 days he calls back :
- Hi, I just got the monitors , everything is fine but I see you  didn't send me the cables you told me about...

I start thinking that maybe the other guy who packed the order may have forgotten the cables so I ask him to check once more if possible just to be extra sure .

- Okay sure I'll check again but I have THE BOXES OPENED so i don't think the cables can be somewhere else.

After a few seconds and while I'm explaining to him that if he checked again and  there are no cables we will send new ones. And this is the answer I got:

,TalesFromRetail,"Happened around 2018 at the arts and crafts store I used to work at. The women's bathroom was notorious for breaking down every other week. For reasons that still elude me, the store never contacted a plumber to handle this. Only thing we were told was that the pipes were old or something. It was already bad enough that they never hired another janitor after our previous one retired, so the Assistant Managers were left dealing with bathroom cleaning on top of their additional responsibilities. 

Anyway, on yet another instance of the bathroom breaking down (floor was flooded), this time around there was 3 rows of tape set in front of the door that also held up a very obvious sign saying in big bold letters that the bathroom was closed and out of order. If you had to go in, you had to duck under the tape to then open the door. The men's bathroom was available, and we just had to knock ahead of time. A sign was placed on the door to briefly explain why.

It was around 10am that day and the store was borderline empty, and with all of us doing our separate tasks, didn't notice a customer even going into the bathroom.

The women&amp;#39;s bathroom was notorious for breaking down every other week. For reasons that still elude me, the store never contacted a plumber to handle this. Only thing we were told was that the pipes were old or something. It was already bad enough that they never hired another janitor after our previous one retired, so the Assistant Managers were left dealing with bathroom cleaning on top of their additional responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on yet another instance of the bathroom breaking down (floor was flooded), this time around there was 3 rows of tape set in front of the door that also held up a very obvious sign saying in big bold letters that the bathroom was closed and out of order. If you had to go in, you had to duck under the tape to then open the door. The men&amp;#39;s bathroom was available, and we just had to knock ahead of time. A sign was placed on the door to briefly explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was around 10am that day and the store was borderline empty, and with all of us doing our separate tasks, didn&amp;#39;t notice a customer even going into the bathroom. What we do notice a short time later is her complaining to a fellow co-worker over how unsanitary the bathroom was and how she was going to sue. One of our assistant managers told her it was closed and taped of for a reason. Customer bluntly said that it didn&amp;#39;t matter.

,TalesFromRetail,"People use the word ""customer"" a lot, even when they shouldn't. We definitely use it way too much for the ones that walk in without intending to pay for the product they take. I think the term thief is more applicable.

 I was about to go on my cigarette break, but my boss calls in over the headset that a man in a blue shirt had just stuffed two products down his pants and was pushing for the exit.

So I look at the shop floor, there were three or four dudes in blue shirts. I know we're not supposed to discriminate based on appearance, but it was obvious who the thief was. It's a certain thing based solely on the way the man looked. Didn't even second guess.

We stop him. He claims not to have anything down his pants, I tell him there's no way he's *that* well endowed, pointing at the *mammoth* bulge that's positioned nowhere near where his natural born equipment should be.

Then I say the words that ruin my day. ""You're a shitty thief, you can't even hide what you're stealing.""

What happened next was a full blown, no joke, I shit you not, honest to god, adult temper tantrum. I got shit off my boss later for very clearly smiling in plain view of the security camera when it happened. He threw the products at other customers (aim was shit, didn't hit a one), so I told him he needs to leave.

He then makes for the exit, and as he's going, in plain view of everyone, takes two chocolate bars off the shelving, one actual customer even said out loud ""Is he fucking serious?""

Apparently he wasn't because he just wanted to throw one of them indiscriminately, not caring if he hit anyone, (my mind goes to it landing right on the soft spot of a babies head or whatever) and then he wheels around and throws it clean at me. First time he actually aimed properly at something because I had to dodge it, and that made me a little angry. So I move toward him, and the absolute slackwit throws a punch right at my jaw before he leaves.

All that, and he didn't even get anything.

It weren't even a good punch too, it couldn't even stop me from moving toward him. But it's still assault and I still pressed charges because fuck that guy.

The image that's clearest in my mind was how he was smiling before he threw the punch. Which is funny to me because he was issued a banning order and arrested two weeks later for what he'd done ""and other charges"" according to the police. I hope he's still smiling.

He left, stood outside doing an ""intimidating"" pose. Looked more like he was trying to keep a turd from crowning.

I could whine and complain about how some customers harrass our female staff, working at another store once I witnessed a customer start stroking a female staffers hair.

,TalesFromRetail,"TL;DR - Angry lady shows up at 2 wanting to use coupons that start at 4pm. Refuses to leave until we finally ring her up at 4:40pm. 

This happened back in 2008, in November. My department store was well into the holiday season, with lines of 20-30 people at any given time. All four registers in our pod were staffed and going full steam as we helped people who often had massive piles of clothes to purchase. It was barely controlled chaos. 

To add to this we had timed coupons that started at 4pm. No exceptions. On this day, I arrived for my 4pm shift to a bit of a commotion.

&lt;p&gt;This happened back in 2008, in November. My department store was well into the holiday season, with lines of 20-30 people at any given time. All four registers in our pod were staffed and going full steam as we helped people who often had massive piles of clothes to purchase. It was barely controlled chaos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this we had timed coupons that started at 4pm. No exceptions. On this day, I arrived for my 4pm shift to a bit of a commotion.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work at a tiny local store which also has a post office in it where we are usually always two people at work, but because of christmas and black friday we are 3-4 people working at the same time.

But a few days ago, we were just two people. It was pretty silent (calm before the storm), so my coworker went away from the register to do some work in the store, restocking etc, leaving me alone at the register to the grocery store and the post office (right next to each other).

The store phone rings, and the second after a customer comes inside, noticably wanting to pick up a parcel. I ask him for his pickup code, he gives it to me. I pick up the phone and go to get his parcel, on the phone. The customer on the phone asks is we have a certain product in stock, i was not sure what product she wanted, but as we are a small store, we usually just have the normal things. But i proceed to give the man his parcel, and go into the first aisle where I thought this product could’ve been. (Keep in mind this aisle, like all of our aisles are tiny and barely 2 meters away from the entrance.)

I cant find the product and the lady on the phone is getting annoyed and asking me if i even know what she is talking about and demanding to talk to someone else that knows stuff, certainly not me to this lady, which is already putting me in a annoyed mood. As i turn around, theres an old couple at the post office wanting to drop off some parcels of their own. My coworker had just come back, and i give her the phone since the lady wouldnt quit, and quickly go back to the post office. Keep in mind once again that this converstation on the phone after me giving the first customer his parcel, was no more than 1 minute.

But to the old couple that probably had stood there for 30 seconds, helping a customer who called in ages before they even were here was a crime. They tell me how disrespecful it is to leave a customer like this alone and to be on the phone. I was literally 2 meters away from them the few seconds i was on the phone.

I explain to them that the customer on the phone called in before them and i was just trying to help her. Which for some reason got them even more mad leading up to the man telling me to smile more and that «its so nice to come here».

I'm at work, otherwise completely uneventful shift (yes, they do actually happen sometimes) when I'm called to the tills.

A customer, who we'll call BFG (Big, Frustrated Gentleman) had a coupon for money off well known Cola brand products, but is trying to use it to buy store brand soda water.

BFG: I bought a 24-pack of Diet Cola here weeks ago, and they were all flat! I had to send them back to the factory for a refund, and they sent me these coupons as compensation.

Me: I'm sorry, but it clearly states on the coupons that they can only be exchanged for Cola brand drinks.

Me: I'm sorry sir, but there's nothing I can do about that. You can always try another shop.

,TalesFromRetail,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate a fireworks company with retail stores. The stores are actually seasonal firework tents, but not like any tents you've seen before. These are massive firework temples, carrying only the biggest and best fireworks available, where the party and the insanity climax on the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve.

**STORY:** Years ago, I had an employee that I had to let go for theft and I wrote a reddit tale about it. [/u/Caddan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Caddan/) asked me about the guy from the story and I realized that I should give an update to the story. I’ll summarize the story below or you can read the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/5dmlpz/what_does_fired_mean_tales_from_a_fireworks_tent/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

The quick recap is that there was a local kid who came every year and begged me to give him a job. I finally caved and put him to work, but it was sadly short lived. My other employees got a laugh from his crazy antics but complained that he wasn’t getting the work done. I gave his strange behavior some leeway, but a few days later I caught him stealing fireworks and had to let him go.

A year later, he showed up wearing the company shirt I had given him and promptly put himself back to work. Apparently, the firing didn’t count anymore since it was last year.

**THREE YEARS LATER…**

A lot of my employees use me for job references. It’s only seasonal work, but I’m more than happy to tell potential employees what an outstanding employee they were. Hell, if you were above average, I’ll make it sound like the future of the company depends on them hiring you. Now imagine my surprise when I got a phone call asking for a job reference for a guy that I had fired almost four year ago. Honestly, I couldn’t even place the name when they first said it. It took me a minute to realize just who the hell they were talking about. He’d been back to shop a few times after the incident, but that was it.

Some of my friends might say that I’m a sucker, or that I let my employees get away with too much, but I like to think that I’m a reasonable guy. I will freely admit that when I figured out who they were talking about, I felt a little ping of guilt and thought that maybe I should cut him some slack. After all, we’ve all made poor decisions or done things that we regret.

HE APPLIED FOR A CASHIER JOB AND USED ME AS A F#&amp;KING REFERENCE! I mean seriously WTF? He even listed his prior job with me as “cashier”. I racked my brain, but the only thing I could come up with was that maybe he assumed they wouldn’t call since it was a seasonal business.

Even I have my limits. I informed the caller that he had previously worked as a stocker for me, that he had been terminated, and that I would not hire him again. I also let them know that unfortunately that was all the information I could provide. My response was a balance of trying to be honest but not opening myself up to legal issues.

Then again, maybe the bad job reference doesn't count anymore since it was last year.",t2_cktp9,False,,0,False,The Job Reference [Tales From a Fireworks Tent],[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,short,0,,False,t3_k8iv10,False,dark,0.98,,public,346,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Short,False,346,,True,,1607360810.0,standard,[],{},,True,,1607384432.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND:&lt;/strong&gt; I own and operate a fireworks company with retail stores. The stores are actually seasonal firework tents, but not like any tents you&amp;#39;ve seen before. These are massive firework temples, carrying only the biggest and best fireworks available, where the party and the insanity climax on the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY:&lt;/strong&gt; Years ago, I had an employee that I had to let go for theft and I wrote a reddit tale about it. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/Caddan/""&gt;/u/Caddan&lt;/a&gt; asked me about the guy from the story and I realized that I should give an update to the story. I’ll summarize the story below or you can read the original post &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/5dmlpz/what_does_fired_mean_tales_from_a_fireworks_tent/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick recap is that there was a local kid who came every year and begged me to give him a job. I finally caved and put him to work, but it was sadly short lived. My other employees got a laugh from his crazy antics but complained that he wasn’t getting the work done. I gave his strange behavior some leeway, but a few days later I caught him stealing fireworks and had to let him go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, he showed up wearing the company shirt I had given him and promptly put himself back to work. Apparently, the firing didn’t count anymore since it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREE YEARS LATER…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my employees use me for job references. It’s only seasonal work, but I’m more than happy to tell potential employees what an outstanding employee they were. Hell, if you were above average, I’ll make it sound like the future of the company depends on them hiring you. Now imagine my surprise when I got a phone call asking for a job reference for a guy that I had fired almost four year ago. Honestly, I couldn’t even place the name when they first said it. It took me a minute to realize just who the hell they were talking about. He’d been back to shop a few times after the incident, but that was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends might say that I’m a sucker, or that I let my employees get away with too much, but I like to think that I’m a reasonable guy. I will freely admit that when I figured out who they were talking about, I felt a little ping of guilt and thought that maybe I should cut him some slack. After all, we’ve all made poor decisions or done things that we regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HE APPLIED FOR A CASHIER JOB AND USED ME AS A F#&amp;amp;KING REFERENCE! I mean seriously WTF? He even listed his prior job with me as “cashier”. I racked my brain, but the only thing I could come up with was that maybe he assumed they wouldn’t call since it was a seasonal business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even I have my limits. I informed the caller that he had previously worked as a stocker for me, that he had been terminated, and that I would not hire him again. I also let them know that unfortunately that was all the information I could provide. My response was a balance of trying to be honest but not opening myself up to legal issues. Sadly, not my first rodeo.&lt;/p&gt;

I seriously wish he’d show up again just so I could ask him what the hell he was thinking LOL. Then again, maybe the bad job reference doesn&amp;#39;t count anymore since it was last year.&lt;/p&gt;

No apology, but she clearly felt at least a little bit ashamed or guilty for not paying attention, because she wouldn't look me in the eye as her friends make faint snickering sounds.

I don't think she was being malicious or trying to lie about not having money until she was called out; I just think she wasn't paying attention at all. She just fired off a ""no"" at random to what she thought was a generic retail question, so she could get back to her all-important conversation. She had no reason to give an anonymous retail person the time of day... until she suddenly discovered that something important was actually happening.

We can all hope that the incident taught her a small lesson, but I'm not taking any actual bets on that.

I tell Cranky that I will do the discounted items first because they manually have to be done in the computer and it's much easier for me.  He seems fine with it while my co-worker (who was trying to be helpful at this point) suggests that I split it into two transactions so that I can make it easier.  I ask Cranky and he seems cool with it at this point so I go with it.  I ring him up with the non-sale items and everything goes fine.

I go to scan the items and some of the SKUs are faded or torn off (these items don't have barcodes on them directly) and I have to figure out or manually type in the SKU number. While I was in the middle of doing this, Cranky takes one of his items and shuffles them around the other ones for some reason.  I internally sigh and count my items while Cranky then complains to me me that he now has to pay double the sales tax (huh?).  I am starting to get vibes from Cranky's son as he looked anxious.  Cranky then tells his son that I was slow and taking my time and I didn't know what I was doing, blah, blah, blah.  I then apologize and then tell him that I am done ringing up the sales items; like I said, the items don't have barcodes on them and have SKUs taped to them and it takes a little bit to get everything scanned; it's an inventory thing. In fact, a customer apologized to me for making things complicated when I had to manually type in the discounts for her stuff (I told her it was no big deal and I dealt with it on a regular basis).

Cranky then tells me to call a manager because he doesn't trust me so I call over my supervisor who tells me that I shouldn't have split the transaction into two of them like my co-worker suggested (but I wasn't in trouble or anything though).  Cranky tells her that he wanted everything to be on one transaction and changed his mind.  Since he didn't pay in cash, we couldn't void the transaction and he'd have to go to customer service to do that.  Cranky sighs and my supervisor tells me to just give him a bigger discount on the already bare bones discount he was getting on the items.

Immediately Cranky shuts up and is more polite when I apply the bigger discount.  He thanks me and leaves with his stuff.  After he leaves, my well-meaning co-worker told me how much of a jerk Cranky was.  CW then tells me that he deliberately shuffled the items to throw me off which I kinda understood as I was scanning his items.

&lt;p&gt;Cranky then tells me to call a manager because he doesn&amp;#39;t trust me so I call over my supervisor who tells me that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have split the transaction into two of them like my co-worker suggested (but I wasn&amp;#39;t in trouble or anything though).  Cranky tells her that he wanted everything to be on one transaction and changed his mind.  Since he didn&amp;#39;t pay in cash, we couldn&amp;#39;t void the transaction and he&amp;#39;d have to go to customer service to do that.  Cranky sighs and my supervisor tells me to just give him a bigger discount on the already bare bones discount he was getting on the items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately Cranky shuts up and is more polite when I apply the bigger discount.  He thanks me and leaves with his stuff.  After he leaves, my well-meaning co-worker told me how much of a jerk Cranky was.  CW then tells me that he deliberately shuffled the items to throw me off which I kinda understood as I was scanning his items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;l bring this up later with my mom and we both conclude that he may have been trying to get a better deal on the sale items.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"New South Wales has very strict RSA laws, that's responsible service of alcohol. If you're selling alcohol and you fuck the rules up and you get caught? You're about to lose your job, lose your qualifications to sell liquor, catch a fine and the people you work for catch a fine too.

I was working at a large chain that sells alcohol, RSA is something we deal with daily. Someone comes in Saturday whose CLEARLY been day drinking? Nope, can't sell it. Usually they chuck a temper tantrum and we have to write an incident report. Gonna be honest, most of the time I refuse service because someone's left their ID in their car, I let them run out and grab it and... I'm pretty sure that on paper I'm *supposed* to write an incident report and refuse service anyway, but fuck it. Managers never bothered me about stuff like that.

We get a lot of drunks that just got thrown out of the pub coming to get one for the road. Usually very thankful security turns them away at the door. We get a lot of kids who pretend to get offended when you ask for their ID. We get kids who think they're smart by coming in a group and thinking we'll process the transaction before we check everyone's ID.

As a rule of thumb, I turn away anyone in a school uniform, ID or not. They can't prove they're not buying for anyone else and I'm not gonna chance it. I know there's no law, but our state has the strictest laws and the most arbitrary enforcement so... Yeah.

We also get kids who think we weren't their age at one point and don't know how to *easily* clock that youre using your older siblings ID.

We also get people who get offended when you check their ID on subsequent visits. Lead to my favorite customer interaction ever.

Customer: You don't legally have to check ID if you recognise the person you're serving.

Me: If.

I wish I could describe the look on that woman's face, it was like I just force fed her salt and garbage.

But that's not the story, here's the story:

So it was a Wednesday afternoon. A lady comes in that's very obviously old enough to purchase alcohol and very obviously sober. She grabs ha case of beer and I don't even think twice, I go to scan the case and then she says ""I'm buying these for my son, he's turning 18 on sunday.""

I briefly consider just letting her through anyway, then I remember that we're in mystery shop time of the month and it's usually around the time of day they come in. Then I realise that my manager is directly behind me. I have literally no wiggle room.

Me: Sorry, can't continue the transaction. State law says you cannot purchase alcohol for a minor.

Her: But he's turning 18 on Sunday.

Me: Today's Wednesday.

Her: That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

Me, on the inside: Is it, bitch? Is it?

Me: A several thousand dollar fine and loas of my job if I'm caught continuing this transaction is not ridiculous to me.

Her: I actually know that, I have my RSA too.

Me, again internally: Getting it's easy, but you clearly haven't made your money back off it or you'd know we can't do this.

Me, externally: [stunned silence]

Her: Can I at least get this wine?

Me: Refusal of service means refusal of service. I can't sell you anything and I'm going to ask you to leave now.

I thought that was the end of it until a customer complaint came in, because my manager recognised her, she threw the complaint out.

Moral of the story: Look, nobody cares if you give your kid alcohol when they hit drinking age.

,TalesFromRetail,"I've worked in a supermarket for 10 years. You get your share of Karens and the only thing you can do is smile politely.
But what I even hated more after an 8 hour shift and having to close up the supermarket were the customers who came in 5-10 minutes before closing and just do their shopping like no one wants to go home.

There was a time that I was scheduled every Friday closing shift and pretty much every Saturday closing shift. The store closed at 8. We weren't open on Sundays then. Also on Saturday we had to take out all the cash drawers and ( manually) count all the money.  We could start doing this when all the customers had left and the front and back doors were locked.

So customers coming in 5 to 10 minutes before closing time and taking their sweet sweet time to shop were hated. Hated with a passion.

My shop had a procedure. We would barricade our entrance and turn our front door on only opening when people wanted to leave the store at about 5 minutes before closing. We would remind customers at a quarter to, 10 to and 5 to closing time that the store was going to close and please go and pay for their groceries.

Normally we had very few incidents.

This one,  however, is burned in my memory.

'
C = colleague, FM= formula man.

It was a Saturday. As head of the cashiers for that night I had the honour to make or break the day of our beloved customers. I had to deal with my fair share of Karens, male and female, and I just wanted to go home.
So I follow the procedure, ask one of my fellow money handlers to set the front door and stay there to handle any customer.

At 2 minutes before closing time a man comes running to the door. My colleague asks what he needs and  reminds him that the store is going to close and he won't have much time. He says he just needs formula.

Since I was busy with a customer she let him in.
Guy gets a basket and goes into the shop. Since he said he needed formula we thought he would be in an out like Road runner. Nope.

No, because FM didn't need formula. 
At 8.05 FM is seen at the cheese section if our store. 8.15 at our wine section. What the heck does he need that for? What kind of baby does he have?
Several of my colleagues have gone to this man to get him to the counter. He scoffs, huffs and says that he's a paying customer. 
My fellow money handler was the last one to go to him and that's when he went too far. He yelled at her, cussing at her and making a high school student cry. 

Now I'm pissed. So I do what I always do in these situations. I take if my store shirt, put out a neat jacket I keep in case of emergencies and put it on. You see, when you have the store outfit on, you are often seen as a lesser being. But behold! I change my outfit and suddenly I look like management and my word is all powerful. The real manager sees this happening, pops out a huge grin and goes to the back and watch from the security cameras.

So I don the magical outfit and go to FM.  I tell him in no uncertain  terms that the store has been closed for 15 minutes and he has been asked multiple times to go and pay for his things. He starts to huff and puff himself up like the big bad wolf ( I'm 5'2 woman and people think they can intimidate me.) 
I told him that he was only allowed entrance since he said he needed formula. So I gave him a choice. He could go now and pay for the things in his basket or I would take the basket from him, grab the formula he claimed to need so much and he could pay for that.
He could choose not to do either, and in that case security would love to make his acquaintance. Either way, he would leave now.

He tried, oh boy he tried to threaten and intimate me.
He failed. 
He left.. with his cheese and wine. And many threats to call corporate.

The next week he came again. This time he encounters me at the door. What did he need? Formula.
So I brought him to our service desk, went inside and brought out a single pack of every kind of formula we had. Asked him which one he needed.
He didn't say a word and left.

You get your share of Karens and the only thing you can do is smile politely.
But what I even hated more after an 8 hour shift and having to close up the supermarket were the customers who came in 5-10 minutes before closing and just do their shopping like no one wants to go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time that I was scheduled every Friday closing shift and pretty much every Saturday closing shift. The store closed at 8. We weren&amp;#39;t open on Sundays then. Also on Saturday we had to take out all the cash drawers and ( manually) count all the money.

,TalesFromRetail,"Hailing once again from the arts and crafts store I used to work at, this event happened on one of the slower days in early spring of 2019. It was just me and a co-worker up front. I was a cashier and they were the front-end supervisor (FES for short) of my shift. In comes a customer with a large bag of electric candles she wanted to return. No problem. If the items still functioned, that meant a full refund, so we tested each candle. Only one of them didn't turn on even with new batteries. FES made sure to mention that that candle in particular wouldn't be returned, and as she headed out back to get some more change for my register, the customer's mood soured almost immediately.

This woman angrily mutters ""who does this 15 year old think she is?"". She was referring to the FES, who at the time was 19. Keep in mind these candles are worth just $1.50 each and this woman got furious. When the FES returned with the change, customer demanded she'd get the full refund for the broken candle regardless, and immediately began to shout every insult she could at her. FES did not hesitate to snap right back while still keeping a big smile on her face, but you knew she was furious by just how red her face was. I was watching on in silent disbelief at how sudden this entire thing escalated.

Customer got even louder and angrier, to the point surrounding customers immediately noticed. Some went as far as defending us while bashing this crazy woman for her unnecessary and extremely rude behavior. Customer simply shouted angrily at them as well, and it got to the point the manager and assistant managers went to the front to see what was going on. The shouting could be heard throughout the entire store. Crazy lady tried to make it seem like both myself and the FES were in the wrong. I stayed quiet throughout this massive shouting match yet I was somehow to blame as well. Karen logic. When the lady realized no one was taking her side, she stormed off, leaving the candles behind without the return being completed, all while threatening to sue.

She never came back.

**EDIT**: I completely forgot to mention, but the customer had no receipt and even though she claimed to have had a rewards account, she didn't have the card and didn't want to use her personal info to look it up (first and last name or just phone number would've sufficed).

It was a Wednesday afternoon in your average discount clothing, homegoods and doorknob store. I was ringing up a lady and her daughter. Her total came out to $30 and she hands me two $20. I go in my drawer and handed her a $10 from the top of the stack and close the register. I was working quickly because I had worked there for long enough that I could do that with little mistakes, and because we had a line building up.
 
This lady looks at her bill and goes ""excuse me can you give me a nice 10?"" And I inform her that unfortunately we are not allowed to open the drawer after it has been closed. ""Its fine, I'll wait, call the next customer and you can give it to me then"" she says. I informed her again that I would not be able to open the drawer for her. She tells me to call the next customer, she can wait. So I look back at my manager who comes over. I explain the situation and she again informs the lady that I could not open the register, and I was not allowed to switch out bills on different transaction.

I'm telling y'all,  it's like we told her we killed her entire family with the machetes we sold. She starts screaming about how I gave her a ""raggedy ass bill"" and how it was going to rip and then what is she supposed to do? She's not going to use it right away. She then yells ""she took my nice twenty pretty damn fast"" and it took all of my strength to not react because what the hell is she accusing me of?

After she left I had to take a couple of minutes to just stare out the window trying to process what the fuck just happened?

I work in an outdoor clothing shop, and our return policy explicitly states that clothing that has been washed is no longer eligible to be returned. Like 20 minutes before close one night, guy rolls into the store with a return. Being the doorman, I chat him up and ask what he's in for, and he says he washed this shirt and now its too small and he wants to return it. I tell him upfront that I don't think he'll be allowed to, but he can go up to the counter and find out for himself. I radio ahead to let them know this one is gonna be a doozy.

My manager tells him he can't return it. Dude proceeds to throw a classic tantrum, like ""what do you mean, it doesn't fit me, I don't wanna keep this"" blah blah blah, and he proceeds to storm out yelling ""You just lost a customer"" over his shoulder. I start making fun of him with colleagues (as you do) and he storms back in to demand the regional manager's name and number. Presumably so he can waste his time bitching about how we won't bend policy for a $40 shirt.

My manager's spine suddenly vanishes and he decides to just give this dude what he wants to get him to go away. He looks up the dude's receipt... and then it hits him. The dude has been claiming this whole time he bought an XL shirt, and that after washing it doesn't fit, can't get his arms through the sleeves. My boss looks at the receipt, looks at the shirt, and realizes this dude bought a large, and tells him.

I wasn't there to personally witness this moment, but apparently the dude just absolutely deflated. All the wind went out of his sails in an instant.

,TalesFromRetail,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail stores. They're actually seasonal firework tents, but not like any tent you've seen before. They're a massive fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax on the 4th of July and New Year’s Eve.

**STORY:** In case you didn’t see it on the news, the US demand for fireworks leading up to the 4th of July was up by more than 200%. I’m guessing it was a combination of people wanting to blow off steam and  cities cancelling firework shows. As you can imagine, the entire sales period was a madhouse, with lots of stores running out of fireworks early. I was actually way overstocked, or at least I thought I was.

In the beginning of 2020, the firework factories in China were unexpectedly shut down for months due to the Covid outbreak, causing a national shortage of fireworks in the US. Luckily for me, I had actually accepted a late shipment of fireworks near the end of 2019 that someone else had refused. Sometimes dumb luck beats careful planning. Welcome to owning your own business!

By late afternoon on the 4th, we were busier than I had ever thought possible. Apparently, we were just about the only place nearby with fireworks still on the shelf, and people were pouring in from all over. We were stocking as fast as we could, and some of our most popular items were quickly running out.

I was bouncing around and trying to help as many people as possible when one of my employees flagged me down. He had some guys who were giving him a hard time, and they wanted to see the manager. I walked over and introduced myself to two guys who were probably in their late 20’s. They were immediately rude, and informed me that they had driven over an hour to buy a specific mortar pack, and that I needed to make it worth their while. They insisted on a 50% discount for their gas and inconvenience. I straight up cry laughed in their faces. Seriously, if you want a deal on Fireworks, don’t wait until the last minute when I’m getting hammered and selling out of everything.

**Me:**  You see those boxes on the shelf? That’s all I have left. The deal is that you should buy one now before they’re all gone.

**Them:**  Blah blah I can get them cheaper somewhere else (idiot, you just told me you drove an hour because I’m the only place that has any left) blah blah…

**Me:**  Seriously, (as I watch the remaining boxes disappearing) you should grab it now if you want them.

**Them:**  Blah blah this other firework store always gives us a discount blah blah

**Me:**  Gentlemen, (as a woman grabs the last box in front of us) the problem has been solved. We’re all sold out.

Apparently, this kicked the stupidity into overdrive.

One of them starts shouting and tries to take the last box from the woman who had just picked it up. I stepped between them and let them know that it’s time for them to leave. They continued yelling at me and kindly offered to kick my ass and set the place on fire, getting the attention of pretty much everyone in the place…including the uniformed off-duty Police Officer that I hire for security.

I told the officer that I was too busy to bother with them and to just tell them to leave. He ran their info anyway and let them debate life in the back of his car for 30 minutes anyway.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work as a baker at a grocery store, covering just about all of the baked goods we sell, from bread, to muffins, to...donuts. We don’t always have every kind of donut, and some are more popular than others, so I try to give as much variety as I can and spice things up a little to compensate. That being said, as you all are probably aware, you can’t always please everyone.

After baking, I work on packaging bread near the counter of my station, opening myself up to the customers and making me vulnerable to questions, that of which I do not mind. Especially in the morning hours, people usually aren’t too keen on talking much, so interactions are pretty quick and painless. Today, however, our star of the show surely did bust out a performance.

At the sound of an “excuse me?”, I made my way over to help as soon as I could. However, before I could greet the customer, I was asked, “Do you have any of the plain donuts?”.

Well no, no we didn’t. Sadly, that’s one of the more popular ones, so we were still waiting to get that restocked. Not only that, but my manager had made a point to tell me that we were out of the old fashioned, so I apologized and broke the bad news.

He didn’t like this much.

He began explaining to me what an old fashioned donut looked like, and although I was completely aware already, I heard him out and apologized once again about the lack of that kind of donut in our stock. 

“Can you go check?” He would ask me, which would make me pause for a moment. Hypothetically speaking, if I did manage to find some old fashioned in stock, the man would find himself waiting there for up to an hour and a half waiting for me to proof them and fry them for him, and not only was I sure this man did not want to spend any more time there than he had to, but I didn’t want to take away space from the other bakers just for one tray of donuts that I was sure we didn’t have anyways.

I calmly informed him of my position and how I had been adamantly insisting on a restock, in which he replied by demanding for a manager. To be frank, my shift was 3 minutes away from being over at this point, so when I gleefully fled off to retrieve a manager, I didn’t bother returning to my station for any longer than I needed to clean it off. 

While I stood cleaning, I heard my manager tell the customer the same thing, in which the man proceeded to melt down about it in front of my manager. Night shifts can really tear at a woman’s soul, so I didn’t bother to witness the chaos that pursued after that, taking the long way through the back doors to the break room in a successful attempt to avoid another encounter.

&lt;p&gt;While I stood cleaning, I heard my manager tell the customer the same thing, in which the man proceeded to melt down about it in front of my manager. Night shifts can really tear at a woman’s soul, so I didn’t bother to witness the chaos that pursued after that, taking the long way through the back doors to the break room in a successful attempt to avoid another encounter. I saw my manager later on, too, so luckily, he survived as well.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I used to work for a store that sold home goods as well as furniture. Though it was all set up together in one building, the two sides of the business were carried on differently, and this is the story of a time when I, from the home goods side, screwed up while taking a call for the furniture side.

This woman had purchased a nice dining room table from us 6 months earlier, but she told me the finish was already ruined and she was very upset. I apologized and asked her a few questions about how she used it. Apparently, she had two young boys and was using the table every day in her kitchen, where it was taking spills and abuse non-stop.

I brought up her sale in our computers and saw there were no notes about care, so I apologized again and offered to replace the table, but warned her that what she wanted was a much less expensive kitchen table. Her dining room table cost $1600 because it was made completely from real, unpressed wood. I told her we could refund the difference.

This lady did not want a kitchen table, she just wanted a replacement of the exact same one. I explained that the pits and stains she was seeing weren't due to any defect in the product, they are just a natural consequence of water and roughness with the material. I offered to help her choose coverings and tablecloths to protect the wood, but she said she wanted to see it. I suggested placemats and coasters, which is when she suddenly became agitated and shouted, ""For $1600, I shouldn't need to use a coaster!""

I was so taken aback, I just blurted out, ""It's made of wood..."" 

And that's when I remembered the furniture salespeople put their notes in a different part of the computer. The saleswoman had written, ""I begged her not to buy this table.""

But I had already promised to replace it, so now I was stuck. I told the customer I found this note that she had been informed of the care ahead of time and warned that the table would not suit her needs. She still insisted on taking a replacement table. I told her that if she didn't use coasters and placemats, the new table would look just as bad in six months as the current table.

,TalesFromRetail,"I work for Trendy Clothing Company in a small megastore (the type where they have a bunch of brands sharing floorspace and a register system but still managed by different people). you have to have special training to work in a megastore-TrendyShop (as opposed to just a Trendy Shop on its own), so when other megastore workers from around the city call in sick i get called in a lot to cover. 

A few months back I got called to work at the megastore in my city's equivalent of Times Square (i.e. big, open late, and full of tourists). It was an afternoon shift and I was on until 9pm as the only person holding down my section. I was wedged between an unattended jungle of big-name sportswear and an equally unattended standard teens brand in the corner on floor 6 of this enormous building. 

At abt 6pm this dude comes in, anywhere between late 40s and mid 60s, in a hoodie and track pants. He is SOAKED, but somehow his clothes are totally dry. Breathing heavily, uneven shave, just generally sets off a bunch of alarm bells especially since there are some weird parts of town within walking distance. He wanders through the sportswear section for a while before he spots me and rushes over to ask for help looking for a second version of a hoodie he was holding. At 6pm on a weeknight, Trendy Clothing Store is not exactly doing a roaring trade, so i figure i can leave my post for a bit. also i don't know how to say no to this dude, because there are no other store workers or customers within eyeshot and i'm not familiar with the layout or codes of this particular megastore. so i was like okay, let's go.

anyway, i help this dude find his hoodie. and then i help him find five more. a pile begins to form on Trendy Clothing Company's designated megastore register. We go for shirts, shorts, hats - every single possible category of sportswear. It just keeps piling up. Hoodie Dude wanders the store, and after a while, starts taking swigs from a bottle of something in a brown paper bag that is Definitely Not Water. i pretend i do not see it. he's thrilled to tell me that he's buying stuff for his friends and is super determined to get enough for everyone.

Eventually, Hoodie Dude is satisfied with his purchases. I look at this enormous pile of clothes (probably about 30 items) and realise I don't have a detagger that can get the security tags off this stuff (big-name-brand uses those clicker tags that beep if you mess with them). I tell Hoodie Dude this, and offer to scan all the items and suspend the transaction so when we move them off to get detagged at another register it'll save time. he's totally chill with this, so i get to work ringing him up.

y'all. his total was $1800.

HE WAS UNFAZED BY THIS. in fact, he was so unfazed that while i was scanning all his hoodies, he LIT A CIGARETTE IN FRONT OF ME. i'd been hanging out with him long enough at this point that i wasn't worried he was planning to shank me, so i casually said ""hey, yo, smoking's not really allowed in here"". he said ""what?"" and hid the cigarette behind his back. somehow he actually thought this fooled me but i let it slide.

i finish ringing him up and suspend the transaction, then think over how we're gonna get all this goddamn stuff across the store to the register with the detagger. ""we'll have to do two trips,"" i say. ""no we won't,"" says Hoodie Dude, and he comes round behind the register, grabs all the clothes off my put-away running rail, lays them on the floor, and loads up his items. ""where's the register?"" he says. i'm kinda stunned, so i just grab the suspension receipt and show him the way over to the other section. we get there and the guys on the register just Look at me. i explain what's going on and they think i'm insane for thinking this guy's actually good for tht much money but they get to work detagging everything.

Hoodie Dude is THRILLED. he's so excited to be buying all this stuff! i give him my best customer service smile and tell him it was a pleasure to help, and he stops me and says really earnestly, ""thank you for taking me seriously. most people look the other way when i walk past. it's been so nice having someone to talk to.""

y'all. i know retail is a hell job but honestly this made my night. i said goodbye to Hoodie Dude and took my running rail back to Trendy Clothing Store, grinning the whole time. this dude had come in looking like a security incident waiting to happen and had turned out to be just a really honest, generous guy who wanted to get something nice for his friends. I went back to check later and yeah, he was good for the sale. All $1800, paid in full with no problems.

Brit- Hello, my wife was in a couple days ago and bought some English Bangers and as you can tell by my accent I am British(he LITERALLY said that) so I know what they should taste like and they have way too much cilantro. 

Me- Well, we do not use cilantro anywhere in the shop, are you sure it wasn't parsley? Also, English Banger is a slang term for  sausages and may be any one of our flavours. Do you know which flavour  you bought?? 

Brit-No it was definitely cilantro, I know that. I don't know what flavour it was. My wife just said Bangers!!

Me- Well, I am not sure what to say but, we definitely have no cilantro in any of our products or in the whole shop actually(I also read him all the ingredients in each of our sausages). 

Brit-  We only buy our sausages at 2 places, your shop and (other shop in a different town). I will have to ask my wife.

Me- ok, well, you ask your wife where she bought them and what flavour they were and call us back. If they were from here, we want to make  this right.

Brit- Ok, I will ask my wife and get back to you.

Me- ok, thank you. Have a nice day.

,TalesFromRetail,"I tried to post this after it happened, but for some reason it wouldn't post. Honestly, I'm still kind of shocked. This isn't something you see often. Or at least not something I have seen often.

I work in a grocery store in Canada, and while the stereotype about Canadians being polite, nice and friendly, mostly holds true (we have been known to apologize to inanimate objects when we bump into them), we do have a fair share of jerks, and definitely more than a few Karens.

You hear the occasional story, or see a post, about someone in the drive thru, paying for the car behind them. Or someone paying paying the difference if the person ahead is a few dollars short. But up until a few weeks ago, the most I had ever seen someone do that for was a little under $20.

I was given a little bit of hope for the future of our species about a month ago. I had someone come through my till that was having trouble with a couple gift cards she had. Two of them rang through no problem, but two kept coming up with an error message I had never seen. I remember something a while back about some cards having issues, but I don't remember if it was one of our cards, or what the denomination was. Anyway, I had suspended the order as she had stepped to the side so she could transfer money from one account to another, but she was having trouble getting her apps to load properly. Not uncommon. My phone drops the signal in the store all the time. Our signal in the store sucks and our WiFi is even worse. It's why I usually text instead of call. Well, the longer it took, the more upset she became and was starting to have a panic attack.

I couldn't fix the cards at my till, but after suspending the order, I was going to take her to customer service so they could sort it out. Before I had a chance though the gentleman behind asked how much she was short. I answered and he said he would cover it. I asked if he was sure, the amount was just under $120, and he said yes.

The girl broke down and tried to tell him no, he didn't have to do that but he insisted. He then handed me $120 to cover her groceries.

I was shocked. He wouldn't take no for an answer so I finished the order, gave him his change and quickly put his own order through. I told him that was very nice of him and I hoped he had a wonderful day.

There are still some caring and generous people out there and given the current world situation, I wanted to share this as a nice change of pace from the crap we all have to put up with on a daily basis.

,TalesFromRetail,"First off. Sorry if the format is weird I wanted to make this somewhat easy to read and I hope this story fits here. Also this is my first post here so I'm sorry if it's not correct. Just figured this would be a fun story for people to read. 

So I work at a retail store and today with it being black friday, I expected it to be somewhat busy and completely full of Karen's. Well boy was I right. I had this following conversation with K (karen)

K:""Where are your uggs""
ME:Right over here
K:""I want a size 5"" 
ME:*sees the 25 pairs of shoes on the table* ... umm in which one. 
K:""I dont know!! Do you think I know what you guys have!!"" 
ME:*picks up a random ugg*  did you want a 5 in this one? 
K:""NO DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A SLIPPER TO YOU??!!"" 
ME:no but you never specified what shoe you wanted in a 5.
K:""I WANT THAT SLIPPER"" 
ME:*grabs a random slipper*  this one? 
K:""OMG ARE YOU FREAKING STUPID"" 
*uses her Walker to go over to the uggs and proceeds to throw the one she wants at me*  ""THAT ONE I WANT IT IN A 5""
Me:Okay let me see what we have. 
*goes and checks in the back.*  We dont have it so I walk back out 
Sorry ma'am but we dont have a size 5 in that one. 
K:""WELL WHEN ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO GET MORE I HAVE BEEN WANTING THAT ONE"" 
ME:I'm sorry I really dont know when are shipments are in. If you want I can order this for you 
K:""NO I DONT WANT YOU DOING ANYTHING FOR ME"" 
ME:okay well enjoy the rest of your time here. Sorry I wasn't more help. 
K:""YOU SHOULD BE SORRY. HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE WHAT I WANT??"" 
ME:because we dont have what you want? 
K:""THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS"" 
ME:Okay well sorry you feel that way. 

And I went to help someone else lol I thought that would be the end of my dealing with her. Nope. She comes up to the register to check out whatever she did want to purchase. 

K: I know these are already 40% off but since you were so rude I think I should have an additional 20% off. 
Me: well I'm sorry ma'am but I'm not allowed to give you an extra discount since they are already 40% off. 
K: *famous line* ""I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER! BECAUSE I KNOW I DESERVE THAT EXTRA DISCOUNT ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING DEALT WITH YOU!""
Me: okay. *calls manager and explains the situation* 

my manager comes over and basically tells the lady she can either keep the 40% that's there or she can feel free to leave since she was not dealing with this today. The K gave her the dirtiest look I've ever seen and threw the shoes over the counter saying that we can go to hell and we've lost her loyalty. We both watched her leave and then went into the back room and laughed about the situation for a bit before going back out onto the floor. The kicker. The shoes were on sale for $20.

,TalesFromRetail,"You read that right. It happened at this arts and crafts store I used to work at as a Cashier from 2015 to 2019. This event in particular happened the week before Christmas in 2018. Christmas decorations were going for less than a dollar each so the current customers I was ringing out, a pair of women, had well over 40 of these tiny decorations worth around 35 cents. One of them sees the price presented on the items being scanned, and immediately tells me something's wrong. 

Turns out the price was scanning at 36 cents rather than the 35 cents presented on the sales signs. Without hesitation they immediately demanded a price change because it would ""add up"" and it would be robbery. Even the assistant manager I called over simply told them that the difference was 1 cent, but they weren't having it. 

While it was store policy to adjust the price to what the sales sign said (when the difference was by a couple of **dollars**), the fact they made such a big deal about a 1 cent difference was baffling.

,TalesFromRetail,"A few days ago a middle aged man climbed up one of the staff’s ladders to grab an item from the top shelf. We don’t allow customers to climb up on the ladders due to safety reasons. I saw him move the ladder as I thought he was just moving it out of the way so he could look at the other items, which he did. Then a minute later he climbed up the ladder to try and grab an item. I was in the middle of serving of a customer when I noticed. I quickly finished the customers transaction then I walked up to him and told him politely, “I’m sorry sir but I’m afraid customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders”. He gets annoyed and says “you saw me move the ladder and didn’t say anything, now you want to say something?” I say to him, “I understand but I thought you were just moving the ladder out of your way to have a look at the items the ladder was blocking”. He then says to me condescendingly, “are you really arguing with me right now?”. Me: “no sir, I’m just trying to tell you that customers aren’t allowed to climb up on the ladders because of safety reasons and because the ladder also does have “staff only” marked on it”. Customer: “keep arguing with me and I’ll have your career ended”. I look at him surprisingly while he and his daughter carried on about how I shouldn’t be arguing with the customer. I went back to the checkout to serve a customer. His daughter waits in the line. She comes up, throws all her items at me with immense attitude, wouldn’t respond or look at me when I asked if she was paying with card or cash. I gave her receipt and she snatched it off me then says, “you’re lucky he didn’t complain”. I was already having a rough day because of Black Friday sales and whining customer after whining customer. I told her to go ahead and complain. She looks at me in total surprise and paused for 5 seconds. She then asks for my name and last name. I gave her my first name. She then asked for my last name, me: “sorry I can’t give you that information”. Daughter: “no worries, I’ll just describe you to head office, blonde and brown hair, with a tattoo. I’ll be filing a complaint about you” me: “lovely, have a nice day”. She stormed out cussing and carrying on. I didn’t mean to respond but I honestly had just had enough that day. I know it’s not much of a response but some part of me still remembered the line not to cross.

,TalesFromRetail,"Short one from last night that kind of highlights my OCD.

One of my responsibilities of an evening is to count the main float before the automatic time lock on the safe kicks in. So, last night I get the sheet of paper that lists how much should be in the safe, as recorded by the morning shift.

£29 in loose £2 coins.

I double check that I didn't miss-read it.

£29 in loose £2 coins.

So I count them, because I'm equal parts confused and amazed at this. There's only £24 in loose £2 coins.

I finish up, by I can't get how someone could come up with an odd number when multiplying an even number. Maths isn't my strong point, but even so.

Fortunately, we have a staff group chat, so I go over to that and ask ""whoever counted the float this morning, how the hell did you come up with £29 in £2 coins?""

Now, you'd think that something like that would get a laugh out of people, but no, they don't see the issue.

So I ask them, ""how many 2's go into 29?'

""14.5"" is the response I got back.

""Ok"", I ask, ""so how many £2 coins do you need to get *exactly* £29?""

I then posted a photo of the paperwork to try and make my point a little clearer. No, I can't post the photo here: data-protection, apparently.

*Somehow*, this gets through to people what I'd been trying to say. Still no response from the person who actually counted it.

The associate making the announcement just says very abruptly, ""Manager to the front"" which is always kinda ominous.

I come up cautiously, looking for some kind of disaster.  The associates look at each other and one finally says to me, ""there's a dog loose in the store and he's jumping on people.""

Some customers had stopped to see him, one had his phone out and offered to call the number on the tag.

The owner answers and panics.  His wife was walking their two dogs in their neighborhood about a mile away.  Rocky got away somehow and made his way over here to the store.  We'd assumed he was a customer's, and he'd gotten out of their car- Nope.  He trotted up into the store on his own and started saying hi to everyone there.

So I grab a chair and sit down in a corner and pet Rocky until his dad arrives a few minutes later.  His dad gets here and Rocky jumps up to greet him.  The owner tells us that Rocky loves meeting new people but hasn't been able to do that this year.

,TalesFromRetail,"I remember working at a grocery store in the late 90’s . It was the day before Thanksgiving.

The store was in an affluent area of town, full of yuppies. Most customers weren’t too bad, but per capita, it was “Ken and Karen”-ville. The women were in ‘Yuppie Camouflage’. They wore beige tans, beige suits, beige makeup, and beige nails. This was several years before the ‘I want to speak to the manager’ haircut, but the attitude was there. 

So we’ve got high-strung customers, during a high stress holiday period, doing last minute shopping before the feast with all the relatives. They were already on the verge of meltdown because most customers have multiple carts, and the last carton of that particular brand of whatever hard to find ingredient required for Great-Aunt Lucy’s casserole is melting in someone else’s cart.

The store was packed and the front end of the store was gridlocked. The customers who weren’t ready to check out couldn’t maneuver very well because the checkout lines extended into the aisles.

I was a hapless clerk just trying to keep the customers from going ballistic while trying to check out their order. Beep...beep...beep. I had just completed an order and was getting ready to run the credit card. I hit the button to activate the reader. 
I swiped the card and it took a long time to process. Eventually it beeps and gives an error. I tried again. No dice. The customer was getting impatient. 

I paged a manager to do a manual override, and process the card manually. We still had one of the old fashioned credit card plates and a stack of the carbon blanks, specifically for emergencies like this. The manager processed the card, I finished ringing up the order and proceeded to the next. One of my coworkers paged the manager to process their card order, and then another and another. The credit card system had gone down.

The manager was running ragged back and forth between the registers trying to keep up with the orders. To try to placate the crowd they got some bag boys circulating through the crowd with cookies from the bakery. 

The front/office manager was on the phone with the support staff at HQ trying to get the credit system back on line. After what felt like hours, the credit system finally came up, we got the customers checked out without too many riots, and I was finally able to punch out.

Anywho, I watch this cocky little dude spray a liberal coat of ""protector"" all over his nice black Gucci trainers. In a moment of pure joy my brain connects the dots and I walk over and I let him know that he had just coated his shoes in furniture polish!

85 came to my counter, usually it's only for lottery, returns/refunds, catering etc...   I take her anyway cause I'd rather get her out of the store.  She wanted to buy a vanilla $150 prepaid credit card on a separate bill.     I told her to insert her card... she tapped.   It turns out to be a credit card she taps...    

Me: Miss for future reference please insert your card when your buying any gift cards.   

85:  I dont have to do that. I made a contract with my credit card.   They let me do whatever I want with it.    If you have issues you should have asked for my I.D instead of telling me what to do with my card. 

Me: Can I see your I.D. then?

85: Are you serious?   I shop here all the time...

Me:  you said you would prefer I had asked to see I.D.   I'm asking.

85: I'm a lawyer I know my rights, your harassing me! 

She kept saying I was harassing her and that she is a lawyer.   She was very defensive, and could do no wrong attitude.   

Me: I'm not harassing you,  I was trying to inform you about our policy and why it is place.

Long story short she asked to see my direct supervisor.   Who backed me up saying our policy came from head office.    85's rebuttle was trying to explain the law.   My supervisor pretty much said 'I dont care about the law, we are just following policy sent from head office. Which I'm sure follows any bylaws/laws.   

85 was not happy about that.  So I called the MOD. Manager on Duty.  He knows nothing.  Just said sorry for the inconvenience.     He came to me and said ""why did you confront her, you know how she is.  Just get her out.""

&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m not harassing you,  I was trying to inform you about our policy and why it is place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short she asked to see my direct supervisor.   Who backed me up saying our policy came from head office.    85&amp;#39;s rebuttle was trying to explain the law.   My supervisor pretty much said &amp;#39;I dont care about the law, we are just following policy sent from head office. Which I&amp;#39;m sure follows any bylaws/laws.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;85 was not happy about that.  So I called the MOD. Manager on Duty.  He knows nothing.  Just said sorry for the inconvenience.     He came to me and said &amp;quot;why did you confront her, you know how she is.  Just get her out.&amp;quot;
FYI  he is the same manager from the last incident.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On mobile, sorry for any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

There I was, stocking shelves and felt that I had to pee (first day at work I went thirsty and I had to pee so badly, but I didn't went because I am stupid). In this grocery store there is one bathroom for customers and because I am new and I didn't get an access card for employees facilities yet, I have to use customers bathroom.


This bathroom is one room with a door that leads directly to a store, so naturally I go in, lock the door and start my 3 minutes break.

I just want to pee.

Suddenly the door opens and an old lady almost gets inside, but sees me in my disgracing position, and starts to apologize, and I start to apologize while trying to pull up my pants, like I am the teenager caught by parents while jerking off. Moment lasts forever, but she finally leaves.


I pick up a little dignity I have left, wash my hands and get out hoping she won't be there, but of course I am not that lucky. I apologize to her again and say that I am sorry, that I probably didn't lock the door properly.

Her: No, I unlocked it.

Me:... how?

Her: With a coin.

Me:...but why?

Her: I had to go and I knocked.

You see, on this door there is a slit on another side of lock and she used a coin to insert it in that slit and unlock a door.

We sold some flat-packed furniture and had a backdoor pick-up for customers to load items into their cars.  The back-of-house staff had to help these customers, and though very hard working, most were quite introverted compared to the front-of-house staff.

Before closing the trunk, my guy walked to the front of the car to see where the rug was in relation to the rear view mirror.  He decided it was too close and turned around to move it slightly, but the impatient customer took that moment to slam the trunk shut.  The rug pushed straight into the mirror, which punched through the windshield.

The customer was furious and I had to go out there and be shouted at.  The customer was insisting my guy damaged his windshield, and I knew this guy wouldn't do that, so I pointed to our camera out there and threatened to bring up the tape (there was no tape - we would have had to get corporate involved and I have never seen them take the store's side over a customer).

,TalesFromRetail,"I work the early shift driving a forklift for a big box retailer. I also assist the front end once we open, by cashiering whenever it’s needed. Which, has been everyday for the last few weeks, with this second wave of panic-stricken, doomsday shoppers. 

Yesterday, my second to last customer approaches my line and informs me that she has two orders. “I want this, rang up separate from this!” She rudely informed me while making wild hand gestures in the direction of her items on the conveyor belt. 

“Sure thing,” I reply, ignoring her abruptness. Customers request separate orders all the time, so this is not an issue at all. I ring up her first batch of items and tell her the total. She pays, and I begin on the second order. Upon finishing scanning her items, I inform her of her second total, and it is at this point that she stares at me with the same look Marty McFly made when his Nikes laced themselves. 

“You want me to pay again?” She asked. 

“Well, yeah,” I answer. “You paid for your first order. This is your second transaction.”

“So, I have to pay again?” She repeated, clearly not understanding what was happening. 

“Ma’am,” I addressed her as politely as I could, “You have two orders. You’ve paid for the first one. Now, I need you to pay for the second.” 

“Won’t that double-charge me?” She asked incredulously. 

“No, no,” I replied. “It’s not a double-charge. You’re not being charged the same amount twice. You’re being charged for your second order. 

The blankness in her stare stripped away what little remaining energy I had left after a long, strenuous, stressful week. I took a deep breath, and attempted to explain the situation once more, as simply as possible. 

“Ma’am, you have two orders. You swiped your card and paid for the first. It’s time now to pay for the second order. The first order is done. Now it’s time to pay for the second. 

The lady momentarily forgot where she was, then after a few seconds, snapped back to reality and swiped her card. Her receipt popped up and I hand her both receipts and wish her a good day. 

And then her fucking brain exploded. “Wait, wait,  that’s not that I wanted!” She exclaimed. “I wanted to pay for this with this card not this card!” She said while waving two separate credit cards at me like I had any control over it. 

My heart sunk into my chest. I was almost done. The supervisor had already placed the ‘Closed’ sign on my lane. I was almost off. I was so close, yet so far away, because this lady clearly wasn’t done with me. 

“I’m sorry,” I said as genuinely as I could possible muster. “All you said, was that you wanted things rang up separately. You said nothing about separate cards. Also, you have the cards in your hand. I’m not the one swiping your cards. I’m sorry.”

“Well can you undo it!” She said. 

“I.... I mean, I don’t know. I’d have to call a supervisor over ma’am. They may be able to refund one order and recharge you so you can you the right...

“What!” She shouted while pulling down her mask would help her hear me. At that point I felt like I was having a brain aneurysm. I collapsed my head and pinched my nose in the standard, “I can’t believe this shit” pose. 

Needless to say, this set her off into a tirade. “What is wrong with you!” She shouted. 

“I’ll get a supervisor. And maybe they can fix it.” I say while both screaming internally and handing her the receipts. 

“That’s a little bullshit,” She said. “You know that! That’s a little bullshit!” 

A supervisor finally arrived and while attempting to explain the issue, the lady cut me off and begin ranting to the supervisor, Rachel instead. She was then escorted to a register by the supervisors podium where Rachel was able to rectify her issue. All the while, the lady was ranting and raving about how awful I am, and it’s all my fault. 

I caught up with Rachel at the time clock a few moments later. “That lady was a bitch,” she said. 

And I agreed. And that was the end of it.

Lady. But blaming me for it, is like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet and claiming your order was wrong.

&lt;p&gt;And then her fucking brain exploded. “Wait, wait,  that’s not that I wanted!” She exclaimed. “I wanted to pay for this with this card not this card!” She said while waving two separate credit cards at me like I had any control over it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart sunk into my chest. I was almost done. The supervisor had already placed the ‘Closed’ sign on my lane. I was almost off. I was so close, yet so far away, because this lady clearly wasn’t done with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry,” I said as genuinely as I could possible muster. “All you said, was that you wanted things rang up separately. You said nothing about separate cards. Also, you have the cards in your hand. I’m not the one swiping your cards. I’m sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well can you undo it!” She said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I.... I mean, I don’t know. I’d have to call a supervisor over ma’am. They may be able to refund one order and recharge you so you can you the right...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What!” She shouted while pulling down her mask would help her hear me. At that point I felt like I was having a brain aneurysm. I collapsed my head and pinched my nose in the standard, “I can’t believe this shit” pose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this set her off into a tirade. “What is wrong with you!” She shouted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll get a supervisor. And maybe they can fix it.” I say while both screaming internally and handing her the receipts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a little bullshit,” She said. “You know that! That’s a little bullshit!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A supervisor finally arrived and while attempting to explain the issue, the lady cut me off and begin ranting to the supervisor, Rachel instead. She was then escorted to a register by the supervisors podium where Rachel was able to rectify her issue. All the while, the lady was ranting and raving about how awful I am, and it’s all my fault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Rachel at the time clock a few moments later. “That lady was a bitch,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I agreed. And that was the end of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, you paid with the wrong card,
Lady. But blaming me for it, is like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet and claiming your order was wrong. You’re the one who fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"This was years ago when I spent a few months working in a charity shop and was surprised at many unscrupulous things that people tried to do, but this guy stands out for his *what-kind-of-moron-do-you-take-me-for* audacity so I still think of him sometimes. I'm writing the gist of the conversation because I don't remember every word that was said. 

For context, in this shop we were fortunate to be in a high-income area, so we were never short of clothing donations and most of it good quality. This meant we didn't put any clothes on the shop floor in anything less than pristine condition and nothing from super-cheap brands, because we didn't have to. There are also several stages a piece of clothing goes through before it makes it onto the rail, so multiple people have checked it for defects. Then we check everything again when we go through the clothes to rotate stuff out, so there's a lot of quality control. 

Anyway, one day I'm working in the shop by myself and a gentleman walks in. We'll call him Mr C, for Mr Chancer. He's carrying one of our shopping bags and heading for the counter, so I hop behind it. 

Me: ""Good morning!""

Mr C: ""I bought this in here the other day and I'd like a refund please""

He reaches in his pocket and takes out a receipt and one of our price tags which he places on the counter. I recognise my own handwriting on the tag, it's for a men's t-shirt and priced almost at the highest I would try and sell a t-shirt for, so I'm expecting to recognise this shirt since I dither a lot before I put a price that high on anything. Pulling off the tag is a bit sus, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt at this point. 

But then... the smell of stale cigarette smoke invades my nose as he reaches into his bag, pulls out what looks like an old grey dishcloth, and drops it onto my counter. Tentatively I unfurl this thing and note that it is in fact a t-shirt, he at least got that right, but the kind of t-shirt that you dread finding in a bag of donated clothes. This stinky rag definitely did not come from my shop. It had *everything* wrong with it. Years of fading and old stains, and the lower half was covered in little holes I suspect were caused by hot-rocks, those burning pieces of hash that fall out of a joint and burn holes in everything. It's also from a brand that would have only cost a couple of quid to begin with, so we wouldn't bother trying to sell it, especially not for the price on that tag.  

Me: ""I'm sorry"" (not really, I'm insulted) ""I don't believe this came from our shop so I'm not going to be able to give you a refund."" (In retrospect I probably could have just been like ""no tag, no refund"", but I wanted him to know that I knew what he was trying to pull.)

Mr C: *rather feigned looking pikachu-face* ""What? Why?""

Me: ""We wouldn't sell clothes in this condition."" (and why would you *buy* it?)

Mr C: ""Are you the manager?""

Me: ""No, but I am the only one here who can give refunds today.""

Mr C: ""Who is your manager? When will the manager be here?"" (and other questions of this type, but he's not acting anything like you'd expect from a disgruntled customer, he doesn't seem sure of himself at all.)

Me: ""She'll be here tomorrow so you're welcome to come back and ask her then."" 

Mr C: ""Well okay then."" *puts his stuff back in the bag and leaves*

Me: *pulls air freshener out from under the counter to clear the smell and get back to whatever I was doing*

I told the manager when she was back at work and she was like ""point him out to me if he comes back"" but afaik he never did.

She gets to my till, I smile and say 'hello, thanks for waiting' politely, as always and proceed to scan and bag her items. I recognise her now she's in front of me but don't let on obviously. Shes not super famous, but I know who she is as used to watch the soap she was in back in the day. Anyway, she's not interested in talking to me or even smiling so I just get on with it, I say bye and she walks off.

I call the next customer over and before I've even had a chance to finish saying hello, I hear the 'beep beep beep' of the door alarms going off. The actress lady marches back over to me, cuts off the current customer and says  'you have failed to remove the security tags' 
I say sorry although I'm certain I did remove them already. I check the items then tell her theres no tags on them. I suggest it could be something else in her other bags but she ignores me and storms of.

I'm abit embarrassed now as theres a massive queue of people just staring. 

I take the items out of her back and yes, all the tags are off, as they were to begin with. I'm getting abit annoyed at her rudeness and quite curtly tell her 'there are no tags on these items, look, I've checked twice , the alarms are being set off from something in your other bags?' 

At this point, another co-worker comes over and asks the lady if she can look in her bags just to check what is setting the alarms off. The lady does not even answer her but just makes a kind of huffing noise and thrusts her bags out to co-worker...co worker checks bags and looks in another stores bag, lo and behold, theres a security tag left on something shes purchased.

The lady, who is still stood in front of the till, kind of raises her chin and looks at me, I just give her a big smug smile , raising my eyebrows and carry on talking to the current customer saying ' thank you for being so patient'.

,TalesFromRetail,"So, this happened a few months ago during the back to school shopping craze that happens every year. I'm an assistant manager at a small shoe store in the trendiest outdoor mall where I live. The company I work for used to have a popular style called Shape Ups and Demi Lovato did a commercial for them years ago. 

This happened on a Sunday. It was just me and my two newest employees. One of my employees was working her second shift ever, this is her first job. Both of them are very sweet, quiet, and sometimes shy girls. We were relatively busy because back to school is our busiest time of year.

 There were about as many parents and kids in my store as we were safely allowed to let in this year when a rather energetic and enthusiastic lady in her mid-thirties came up to the register wanting to use some rewards points. We inform her that we have no way in our current POS system to look up any of her account information like points and that she will need to pull up the coupon on her phone and bring it to us. Like most malls in the U.S. our store is a black hole for reception  and I have to steal wifi from the Fossil next door just to do my job every day. We inform her that she can get better reception by the front door/ by the windows.

It is at this time that I realize that I haven't used the restroom in a while, so I excuse myself as the girls are explaining the reception to this customer. I came back a few short moments later and there were tears in their eyes and they were struggling not to laugh.

Apparently, this woman decided that just walking to the window was not the course of action for her. Instead, she shouted ""TO THE WINDOOOOW, TO THE WALL, TO THE SWEAT DRIPPING DOWN MY BALLS, ALL THEM BITCHES CRAWL"" and the rest of the chorus while she walked up. In a room store full of children with their parents, no less! My employees said that conversation stopped for a moment because it was such a display. Thee customer bought like 8 pairs of shoes for $400.00, so I guess it all worked out. I had a few parents joke about it with me at the register about it, so I don't think too many people were offended.

We inform her that we have no way in our current POS system to look up any of her account information like points and that she will need to pull up the coupon on her phone and bring it to us. Like most malls in the U.S. our store is a black hole for reception  and I have to steal wifi from the Fossil next door just to do my job every day. We inform her that she can get better reception by the front door/ by the windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at this time that I realize that I haven&amp;#39;t used the restroom in a while, so I excuse myself as the girls are explaining the reception to this customer. I came back a few short moments later and there were tears in their eyes and they were struggling not to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this woman decided that just walking to the window was not the course of action for her. Instead, she shouted &amp;quot;TO THE WINDOOOOW, TO THE WALL, TO THE SWEAT DRIPPING DOWN MY BALLS, ALL THEM BITCHES CRAWL&amp;quot; and the rest of the chorus while she walked up. In a room store full of children with their parents, no less! My employees said that conversation stopped for a moment because it was such a display. Thee customer bought like 8 pairs of shoes for $400.00, so I guess it all worked out. I had a few parents joke about it with me at the register about it, so I don&amp;#39;t think too many people were offended. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish I had waited a few minutes to use the restroom so that I could have seen this glorious display.&lt;/p&gt;

So ever since I started my job in early August, I noticed that there was always this homeless lady that roamed the store going from asile to asile day after day. She would be at the store just about every day, from open to close. Even when I went there on my days off to shop! I don’t know what her particular situation was in regards to her mental state but she would sometimes make really weird and random sounds in the aisles and it kind of freaked out the costumers from time to time (I am in no way meaning to make fun of her if she does have some type of mental illnesses or disability. Just stating what I noticed while working there) but we never asked her to leave since she was usually pretty quiet and we didn’t bother wasting the time or money calling the police or anyone else, but what we did notice, is that she had some source of income because she somehow had a smartphone and always had money to buy food or other items in the store.

I immediately bee-lined it for the self check-out late mentioned over the walkie (which was now closed for obvious reasons) and saw, to my disbelief, the homeless lady on the ground, on her hands and knees, with the paramedics next to her trying to calm her down and (what looked like) them telling her to breathe deeply.

I also work late shifts most nights so, it gets 
Interesting.

Anyways tonight I had 2 fine glossy eyed specimen enter my store and they set off a few retail red flags immediately, so I kept an eye out, but offered my assistance and didn’t bother them while they looked around. For some context, everything in my store is under a magnet lock so I  have to come over and unlock whatever product they are wanting off the hook. They asked me to come grab a few items off the wall and put them behind the counter while they continued to browse.

As I head back to the counter I hear a tell tale cardboard rip and see that the lady had ripped a box of lingerie off the hook and was examining it. (While swaying drunkenly mind you) I walked over and gently asked for it back from her so I could tape the product back up since the box was all mangled now and she didn’t want it. As I’m turning around to do this she rips off another one. 

I turn around and calmly say “Hey could you just be careful not to rip the merchandise off? I can grab anything if you want to look at it.”
She apologized immediately and slurred that she was just trying to see the back, I told her it was not an issue.  (probably just heavy drunk hands) So I took both items back behind the counter to fix.

As I did this, Drunk hubby walks up to the counter and raises his voice at me as his wife continues to look around 

(Side note, I’m incredibly upbeat and cheery, that’s just naturally how I am and It works great to de-escalate situations. So imagine me genuinely smiling and being helpful through all this)

M: “Because I asked her very nicely to be careful with the products?”

D: “ ITS NOT LIKE SHE DID IT ON PURPOSE!!! I’m coming back tomorrow to speak to your boss!”

Me: “okay for sure feel free!! I’m just doing my job making sure stuff doesn’t get damaged. Anything else I can help you with?” (my boss will honestly probably tell the guy to fuck off)

D: “NO. We’re leaving. “

W: *looking intently at the wall of vibrators* “Wait hold on I like this one”

D: “Babe lets go, we’re fucking LEAVING. NOW”

W: *looking at 3 different vibrators* “Wait” 

D: (practically screaming at this point) NO. NOW.

M: “Can I help you choose from any of those?” 

D: “I SAID WERE FUCKING GOING NOW”

W: “One more minute. Does this one recharge?”

Me: “No, not that one! But I do have this one over here that’s 40% off and is rechargeable :)” 

W: “It comes in pink?”

Me: “Yup right here!”

W: “And waterproof? “

M: “Absolutely! “

W: “Yeah I’ll take that! “

So he stands with his arms crossed and brows furrowed while I grab the products for them, then he has to fork over $350 for all the stuff they grabbed.

I work at a gas station in a small town in the US. For many years (all of my life) the legal age to buy cigarettes here was 18 but on December 20, 2019, the President signed legislation amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and raising the federal minimum age for sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years.

So almost but not quite a whole year ago the law was federally changed so it's the law everywhere across the entire country, in every state, in every county.

That brings us to just last week, I'm having a typical work day and all is going normally when this guy walks up to the counter wanting a pack of smokes (I forget which brand) 

I grab the cigarettes and scan them then ask to see his ID..... This is where he either had an extreme level of confidence or really thought I was stupid (the following conversation makes me think he thought I was stupid) or not paying attention.

See in the state I live in the ID of those under 21 will say on them in red letters 'under 21 until (insert random date)' in the case of this guy his ID said he was under 21 until 2022.

Me: ""I'm sorry sir but you have to be 21 in order to purchase cigarettes""

Him: ""it's okay, I'm from another county. They sell to me all the time""

Me: ""I'm sorry but it's a FEDERAL law""

Him: ""there's nobody else here, nobody has to know""

Me: ""I'm sorry, I can't help you""

I hit cancel on my register and put the pack of cigarettes back on the shelf behind me, dude legit stomps his foot (I've delt with some Karen's in my time but so far no one beyond the age of 10 throwing actual temper tantrums) 

He leaves slamming the door as he exits, I watch out the window as he hops into this purple sports car, he revved the engine and peeled out of our parking lot as if being chased by demons squealing his tires as he does.

Not even a minute after he leaves the store phone rings, I answer and on the other end is the cashier who works the liquor store down the road.

Liquor store Lady: ""I'm probably too late because I had customers and couldn't call right away but wanted to warn you about a kid trying to buy cigarettes heading your way""

Me: ""drives a purple sports car? Claims to be from another county? Isn't actually 21 for 2 more years?""

Liquor store Lady: ""That's him! He tried to bribe me!""

Me: ""yeah he just left here, I already told him no""

We have a bit of a chuckle and talk about the strangeness of it.

&lt;p&gt;I work at a gas station in a small town in the US. For many years (all of my life) the legal age to buy cigarettes here was 18 but on December 20, 2019, the President signed legislation amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and raising the federal minimum age for sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So almost but not quite a whole year ago the law was federally changed so it&amp;#39;s the law everywhere across the entire country, in every state, in every county.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"Firstly, thank you all for this amazing sub! As a fellow retail worker its really nice to talk with people who understand. I originally posted a 2 part very long (longest post I had made ever) about a crazy day that happened 3 weeks before lockdown. This got auto deleted but a very nice mod said I can post one incident from the day here So let me set the scene:

I (30F) work in a popular high street store and on this day I was assigned to door duty meaning I had to make sure there were only 500 people in our store (its a huge store with 4 floors) because they were short staffed that day. Most customers were pretty good and wore masks. Sadly not all were so understanding.

Of all the difficult customers I had this one I think was the worse, because it was, to me a surprise how he acted but in hindsight not so much.

This difficult customer just walked straight into the store and  when I jumped in front of him and asked if he had a mask he made a grumbling noise and after a moment staring at me pulled it up (it was just under his shirt). Because of that I didnt think there was an issue. WRONG. When he got to our  sanitizer station (which was about 12 feet away from me) He starts  shouting """"this one 'ere (pointing at me) says I need to wear a f\*\*king mask but the hand sanitisers are not working!"" Before I could say anything another customer near him said ""maybe if you look where you are  putting your hands that would help"" as the sanitizer was working but  takes a moment, so as he was too busy looking at me and shouting he got   the stuff all over his shoe. What got me was the fact he made a fuss about wearing his mask why would he care if his hands were clean?

,TalesFromRetail,"So yesterday I was acting as manager on duty and was strolling through the store making sure everything was fine when I see a middle aged couple gesturing towards me to get my attention. My first thought was ""how rude..."" And went to see what the issue was. Then they started to ""ask"" for a shoe size pointing to the size marked on the box and then I thought they might be tourist who didn't speak the language. No problem, I just started to speak slowly and clearly and throw some english in case they spoke english when then I notice they didn't have an accent when they tried to speak, it was more of a growl, and they spoke between them in sign language. That's when it clicked, they were deaf and couldn't hear a thing I said, and couldn't read my lips. 
Well, I did my best to assist them by going with them through every shoe looking for the size they wanted and calculating the final prize of shoes after promotions... Even gave them some of my personal thoughts on how specific shoes looked. All of that with basic gestures and mimic since I can't speak sing language. Although at the end I realized I could just take out my mobile checkout device and use the notepad app to write down some sentences, which helped a lot. 

At the end they left with a shoe they were buying for a present for a really nice price and they were extremely grateful for the help. 

This really made my day and made me realize that we usually remember and focus on those one in a hundred costumers who are rude and cause a scene, but don't pay attention to the vast majority of costumers who are kind and grateful.

When I worked retail, there was a couple that brought in their special needs son every day because he loved our store. I don’t know why, but I felt a need to connect with him—maybe I just really wanted to be extra kind to him and his parent. Anyways, I spend a solid year just waving to him and saying hi, to which he would respond with a brisk wave and keep going.

One Halloween I found out he loved Blow-pops so I started keeping them in my locker and offering him one (with his parents’ permission) when I would say hello, which he almost always accepted. He really started warming up to me after a few months of daily hellos and lollipops.

One day I was talking to his mom about an order she had placed and he walked up to us with his dad. I said my usual hello and offered him a lollipop, but this time was different.

That was the day he hugged me. A real, affectionate, joyful hug. I cried right then and there while I hugged him back. I looked at his mom, who also had tears in her eyes, and told her how special that moment was to me. I was so grateful for that little moment.

Over the next year or so we continued our daily greetings, sometimes with a hug but most of the time with just a hello and a thank you. I knew his family was  in the process of moving out of state, so I did my best to appreciate every moment while I still could.

On their last visit to the store (which I knew because they had told me what day they were leaving the state), I gave Noah the biggest bag of Blow-pops I could find and told him how much I was going to miss him. He hugged me tight and didn’t let go, so I hugged him back for as long as he needed. When he finally let go, he looked me in the eyes and told me that he was really going to miss me too.

I cried as I said goodbye to him, then cried more as I said goodbye to his mom. I let her know how special Noah was to me and how grateful I was to her for trusting me around him, then I wished them safe travels and a happy life.

To this day I wish I had taken a picture with Noah to remember those little moments better, but I still think about him all the time.

,TalesFromRetail,"Working in Midwest Grocery chain, SCO, you come across many types of customers. Some that know what they are doing. Most do not. So I try my hardest to teach the customers. Explain why im being flagged over to ""help"".

SCO is generally for small quick orders. We don't usually enforce larger order to go to the lines, but I always remind the customers that come through with big orders that it will flag me a lot (ususally doubling their time checking out)

Today I had a Karen come through SCO. Cart full of items. After 2 items it flags me. I come over to help her and remind her that the scale/bagging area Needs the items placed on it or it will flag me, as they are super sensitive. 

She tells me thats stupid, and I'm stupid for it. 

I walk away ignoring her. A few more items. It flags me again. I go clear it. Another snide comment about how senative the bagging area is. I remind her its meant for small items and if you let the bag ""rest"" after moving it there will not be more issues. She scoffs.

&lt;p&gt;She tells me thats stupid, and I&amp;#39;m stupid for it. &lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"So this happened in 2019, I think later 2019 I don't remember exactly when this happened. It was about an hour left in my shift and of course I was ready to go home. I think this woman come up ready to check out and it started out like every other transaction. I said my usual greeting and she was nice...at first. I finished ringing up her items and told her her total. She decided her choice of method was check (yes we still take check).

Now I would like to point out (as it says in the title) that the check machine on the register I was on wasn't working. I know this because I had this problem with my last customer literally before my break. Luckily the couple was very understanding and patient while we were trying to fix that.

Anyway, back to the story. The woman filled out the check and gave it to me and after filling out the necessary information on the check (just some driver's license info). I then started to put the check in the check machine and of course as expected it didn't run through. 

Now I admit I should've told this woman that the machine wasn't working, but for some reason I was thinking it would work this time. So I did what I did last time this happened. I called someone over my walkie to come to my register. 

Now I apologized to this woman for the inconvenience as one of my coworker came over to help me out. I told her how the machine wasn't working right and I was getting someone to help get it to work so we can get her receipt (someone from customer service). Now this is where things start to go downhill. 

The cast of this story is me, RL (rude lady) CW 1 (coworker 1), CW 2 (coworker 2, who doesn't really talk or interact in this story, but does play a minor role), and M (manager, who also has a minor role). The following conversation may not be 100% accurate due to this happening a while ago.

Me: I apologize ma'am, but the machine isn't working. It wasn't working earlier so I will get someone over here to help fix the issue

RL: oh...well I don't have time for this. Can't I just go to another register to pay?

Now I would like to point out that the money that she paid was already in the system so if she went to another register, she would've been double charged and her total was almost at $100. But I didn't know that at the time.

Me: well...um...

So RL went to CW 2's register to ""check out"" and I stood there dumbfounded and not knowing what to do. A few moments later, CW 1 walked up to my register and asked what the issue was. I told her what was going on and my eyes shifted to RL who was at CW 2's register. She followed my gaze and she walked up to her.

CW 1: ma'am, you're going to have to come back here and finish your transaction. Your check has already went through the system so you're going to be charged again if you continue checking out with her (CW 2).

RL looks at us before walking back over. Now I would like to say, I didn't really say anything for this next part, and as I said in another story, I'm nonconfrontational so in a way I felt like I was being protected a little in some way from feeling RL's anger and frustration by myself.

RL: I don't have time for this! I'm in a rush! I've been here trying to check out for 20 minutes (it was more like 5-10 minutes)! I need to pick up my kids!

CW 1: I understand ma'am, but we were having problems with the machine earlier so we'll try to figure this out. 

RL: well then I should've paid in cash shouldn't I?!

CW 1: Ma'am, let me fin-

RL: no! Hush and let me finish! I'm in a rush! I've been here for 20 minutes now! I need my receipt!

So after a few back and forth, CW 1 eventually called M over the walkie. She said she would try to find her transaction and try to get this sorted out.

I don't remember how, but we eventually got her receipt. I apologized to RL and she kind of ignored both of us and looked at CW 2 (who was kind of watching this interaction happen) and thanked her for her help and left. At that point, CW 1 told me to go to a different register for the rest of my shift since the check machine wasn't working.

At that point there were 45 minutes left in my shift and I was just ready to go home. I soon then talked to CW 2 about the incident since I was just done with my shift at that point.

I said my usual greeting and she was nice...at first. I finished ringing up her items and told her her total. She decided her choice of method was check (yes we still take check).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to point out (as it says in the title) that the check machine on the register I was on wasn&amp;#39;t working. I know this because I had this problem with my last customer literally before my break. Luckily the couple was very understanding and patient while we were trying to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the story. The woman filled out the check and gave it to me and after filling out the necessary information on the check (just some driver&amp;#39;s license info). I then started to put the check in the check machine and of course as expected it didn&amp;#39;t run through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I admit I should&amp;#39;ve told this woman that the machine wasn&amp;#39;t working, but for some reason I was thinking it would work this time. So I did what I did last time this happened. I called someone over my walkie to come to my register. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I apologized to this woman for the inconvenience as one of my coworker came over to help me out. I told her how the machine wasn&amp;#39;t working right and I was getting someone to help get it to work so we can get her receipt (someone from customer service). Now this is where things start to go downhill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cast of this story is me, RL (rude lady) CW 1 (coworker 1), CW 2 (coworker 2, who doesn&amp;#39;t really talk or interact in this story, but does play a minor role), and M (manager, who also has a minor role). The following conversation may not be 100% accurate due to this happening a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I apologize ma&amp;#39;am, but the machine isn&amp;#39;t working. It wasn&amp;#39;t working earlier so I will get someone over here to help fix the issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RL: oh...well I don&amp;#39;t have time for this. Can&amp;#39;t I just go to another register to pay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to point out that the money that she paid was already in the system so if she went to another register, she would&amp;#39;ve been double charged and her total was almost at $100. But I didn&amp;#39;t know that at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: well...um...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So RL went to CW 2&amp;#39;s register to &amp;quot;check out&amp;quot; and I stood there dumbfounded and not knowing what to do. A few moments later, CW 1 walked up to my register and asked what the issue was. I told her what was going on and my eyes shifted to RL who was at CW 2&amp;#39;s register. She followed my gaze and she walked up to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CW 1: ma&amp;#39;am, you&amp;#39;re going to have to come back here and finish your transaction. Your check has already went through the system so you&amp;#39;re going to be charged again if you continue checking out with her (CW 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RL looks at us before walking back over. Now I would like to say, I didn&amp;#39;t really say anything for this next part, and as I said in another story, I&amp;#39;m nonconfrontational so in a way I felt like I was being protected a little in some way from feeling RL&amp;#39;s anger and frustration by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RL: I don&amp;#39;t have time for this! I&amp;#39;m in a rush! I&amp;#39;ve been here trying to check out for 20 minutes (it was more like 5-10 minutes)! I need to pick up my kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CW 1: I understand ma&amp;#39;am, but we were having problems with the machine earlier so we&amp;#39;ll try to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RL: well then I should&amp;#39;ve paid in cash shouldn&amp;#39;t I?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CW 1: Ma&amp;#39;am, let me fin-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RL: no! Hush and let me finish! I&amp;#39;m in a rush! I&amp;#39;ve been here for 20 minutes now! I need my receipt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after a few back and forth, CW 1 eventually called M over the walkie. She said she would try to find her transaction and try to get this sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember how, but we eventually got her receipt. I apologized to RL and she kind of ignored both of us and looked at CW 2 (who was kind of watching this interaction happen) and thanked her for her help and left. At that point, CW 1 told me to go to a different register for the rest of my shift since the check machine wasn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point there were 45 minutes left in my shift and I was just ready to go home. I soon then talked to CW 2 about the incident since I was just done with my shift at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just hope wherever that lady had to be in order to talk to us like we were incompetent, she got there on time.&lt;/p&gt;

First-time poster.

Back story: This is from 20 years ago or so. I had worked in a convenience store/gas station. Being I'm in NJ, I  was a late-night gas jockey. For those that don't know New Jersey is the only state that does not allow you to pump your own gas. every station is a full-service station, and the state has some of the lowest fuel prices around. Being a full-service state can lead to some funny moments for out-of-staters who don't know what full-service is. There are signs everywhere notifying everyone that you are NOT allowed to pump your own gas and there is a fine for doing so.

now with that out of the way onto the story.

Me = as if you can't guess :=3

EPD = Entitled Pennsylvania Driver

MOD = Late night store manager

SM = Store manager

The set up is EPD would come in around 4 am to get fuel. He always wants me to put in an extra 3 gallons of fuel in his car after the nozzle clicks  off. Thing is the law states that once it clicks off that's it. You're  supposed to remove the nozzle from the filler. However, most attendants will ask if you want it round it up to the twenty-five cents or dollar,  but never more.

I've told this EPD that I wouldn't do it, because if there was a spill I would have to clean it up.

EPD pulls in: Fill it up, regular.

Me: Sure

EPD: I want that three extra gallons after it clicks off.

Me: Sorry, you know I can't do that.

EPD goes into the store and buys something.

I'm in the booth that has the register and controls for the pumps.

Pump clicks off and EPD grabs the nozzle and starts putting more fuel into his car. I get an evil grin and hit the shut-off for that pump. EPD  starts trying to figure out what was going on.

I come out and say, ""what's wrong?""

EPD It stopped working!

Me: You broke the pump! How did you break my pump?

EPD: Figuring out I probably shut the pump off: Get your manager. I want my gas! I'll have you fired.

I call on our radio for the manager. She comes out and EPD starts ranting of how he wants my job.

Now,  I'm tired, have put with his BS for weeks now, have been working since  11p, and I can get very snarky. This is where I shut him down.

Me:  Ripping off my radio and headset and thrusting them to him, ""You want my job? You can have it! I could be in bed sleeping right now!"" The last was said while I was pointing in the general direction of my house.

The  MOD is almost on the ground laughing. EPD is just standing there looking at me dumbfounded as I wasn't shaking in my boots pleading for my job.

Later SM walks in and calls me into his office.

SM= What happened last night?

I explain.

SM:  Sighs! If he keeps up with this I'll ban him from the store. (I don't  think SM could've done that, but it was nice he was on my side.)

Apparently EPD has been a pain for months and SM was getting tired of his BS.

Only worked there a few more months and very rarely saw EPD again. SM is now in a  high-level position with the company and he always had his employees'  backs.

Sorry, for the ramble, but I always chuckle when I think of how I shut that guy down. :=3",t2_8v2o9web,False,,0,False,Entitled Gas Customer,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,medium,0,,False,t3_jt1zxj,False,dark,0.97,,public,718,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Medium,False,718,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1605240194.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-time poster.&lt;/p&gt;

Names are changed for privacy reasons.

Working at a thrift store can be fun, but you also get those big buys sometimes. My general job includes: putting clothes on the racks, shifting them around, pulling clothes from the racks, cleaning the store, working the jewelry cases, and working the register.

The way we ring things up at the register is that there are specific keys on the keyboard. Example: a red houseware for 79¢ would be typed in as red, ware, .79. 

I was working a 1-6:30 a month or so ago. It was around 4:00 when I noticed my coworker, Linda, was at register 2 with a whole lot of glassware. I minded my own business and went back to what I was doing. I walk by again, she’s still up there. And again. I notice there’s a cart stocked full of glass, and I thought, “there’s no way.”

I still was putting clothes away when my manager told me to help her. Funny enough, it was a customer’s order. I was supposed to wrap every single glassware after my Linda typed it into the register. Every. Single. One. Most of them were 79¢ or 99¢. I come to notice all of the boxes around us. They were full, full of already wrapped glass. “Are you kidding me?”

Low and behold, while she was doing all that work, I was just putting racks away, like a bitch. I then look to my right, and see *another* shopping cart overflowing with glassware. “It’s going to be a long shift.”

Occasionally the guy buying everything would come back with MORE. So, for the next TWO HOURS, I did nothing but wrap glass at the register. We close at 6:00 during the week, and are pretty understaffed. I could’ve been doing so many other useful things. So I wrapped glass until we closed. It ended up being three or four shopping carts full of glass, costing him $394.

I worked in a grocery store chain, so we were all about efficiency and speed; I had like 7 minutes per cake to fully assemble and decorate standard case cakes (LMAO that didn’t happen but I tried). We could have 15 minutes for custom orders. The hours we were allotted for cake decorators for one week depended on how productive we’d been in previous weeks (the system counted automatically every time we printed a label for a cake).

He also wanted me to write each cat’s name so they’d know who was who. He tried to describe each one of his friends to me in terms of appearance, notable characteristics, and hobbies.

Well one day my brother (shop owner) gets a call from a client. He wants work done but we have been having trouble getting the size out of him and we can't proceed with the work and pricing without a size too go by.

So the guy tells him ""I want it the size of a tomato slice."" And a back and forth argument ensues for the better part of twenty minutes.

Finally he convinced the guy that tomato slices are not a good way to measure things. So the guy has another brilliant idea; ""I need it to be the size of my palm.""

By this point my brother is extremely agitated while the rest of us in the office are trying to keep our laughter quiet during the call on speaker phone.

I wrote a quick note and passed it to him with my own idea, so that's what he told the customer. ""Do you have a ruler anywhere near you?""

""Yes?""

""Could you measure your palm for me and tell me in inches?""

There is a long, pregnant pause, a soft ""oh"" on the other end, and finally we get the measurements for the piece he wants. That makes it easier to price.

The guy wants the works, high detail, a lot of color, everything he can think of. So my brother totals the price up and we get an argument. ""Why is it that expensive?""

""This piece has a lot of fine details, a lot of colors, and will require a lot of material to complete it.""

""Well (rival shop who's clients always end up with us to fix mistakes) will charge me half that!""

Our other brother who had been silently laughing with me in the office whispered ""yeah, and it's half assed is why"" causing me to bark out a loud enough laugh I had to leave. He stepped out after the argument and told me shop owner brother told the guy to go there to get his work done, and later to stop by if it needs to be fixed, but fixing a screwed up piece costs double (well, at least in dude's case anyway) then ended the conversation.

Tomato slice guy came in three weeks later with a piece that needed to be fixed severely. Apologized, and seemed very remorseful for choosing the cheapest option available for such an important work.

While in our equivalent of high school, I had a after school job in a supermarket.  
I would go home from school, change into my uniform, quickly eat and then ride my bicycle to the store, about 10/15 minutes from my house.

  
One day I was almost at work when I saw 2 teens in front of me, both on bikes and messing around.  
I guessed they were around 14/15. They were swerving all over the road so I used my bell to make them notice that I was trying to pass them. But when I did, they just looked back at me, smirked and slowed down while swerving even more so I couldn't easily pass. After a while I saw opportunity, ringed my bell again as I made speed to pass them, at which point Teen 1 pushed the other one into me. Luckily I saw what was happening and pulled my brakes to stop. Teen 2 fell into some bushes and I quickly passed them from the other side and went to work.  


Now the retail part. I had clocked in and was still a bit pissed about what had happened. I was on filling duty so I had to put new products on the shelves. Suddenly I heard laughter from the end of the aisle and low and behold, teen 1 and teen 2 where walking towards me, smirking.  
They asked me where some product was, and as bad as i wanted to say to them to go bother someone else, i had to help them. I showed them the product (some kind of candy) and there were a few choices of the brand. They asked me which one was the best, I gave them my opinion. They took the other options except my recommendation (haha good joke ??). They kept asking me which choices were the best for a few other brands and repeating the ""joke"". Eventually i knew my manager would see this as wasting time and told them that everything here is good, in a very annoyed voice.  They started laughing and saying they'll report me to  my manager for my lack of customer service, at which point I pointed to my manager at the end of the aisle and said: ""What a coincidence, there he is. Go bother him so I can go back to work"".  


Their laughing stopped, I left them there and went back to work. They didn't approach my manager, so when I got to his aisle I told him in short he might get a complaint about me. He asked why and i told him the story.

,TalesFromRetail,"I spent a year+ working for a relatively large liquor store.  While I'd love to have one big epic story, I don't but I do have a few novelty short ones:

Our manager was ok if we drank on the job as long as we drank in an area with no cameras (which he pointed out), and made sure to place anything we drank in the ""damaged goods"" section in the back of the store to go back to the manufacturers. He also said not to drink to the point we were drunk and not to drink so much inventory that the owner would notice. I never took advantage of this, but the manager (and many employees) sure did. Which is probably what resulted in the next story.

My manager had an initiation ritual for all new hires. At the end of their first night shift, he'd have them ""turn off the neon signs."" This was done by climbing a ladder to one particular sign and to stick your finger in a hole that had a button on the end that would shut the sign off.  What was actually there was a pair of loose wires. Touching said wires would give you a nasty shock, so bad that I almost fell off the ladder from it, and had a burn on my finger that lasted several days. To this day, I'm shocked he never got in trouble for this.

We've all had little kid runs around unsupervised, knocks stuff over, and the parents don't care because it's the retail workers jobs to clean up their messes. But I've NEVER seen a kid like the one I saw one summer afternoon.  A dad comes in with a 9 year old son. The dad is scoping out wines, and I ask him if he needs any help. He chuckles and turns to the son and ask, ""I don't know, Billy. Do we need help? Mommy is planning on making salmon tonight."" Without missing a beat, the kid turns to his dad and says, ""Pinot Noir would be great if it came pre-chilled, but a Chardonnay would also be great. If mommy is making an Asian style salmon, I'd pair it with a Pinot Gris or Riesling."" The kid had the perfect wine pairings for his mom's dinner, spoken like a true sommelier. I was impressed, and a bit worried.

Our town got hit with a massive summer storm. We're talking record winds, golf ball size hail, and lightning that kept knocking our power out.  Most of us who drove to work left early in order to get their car under some cover. You'd think with the terrible weather we'd have just closed shop, but that evening was our busiest outside the Fourth of July. People were running into the store, soaking wet and covered in small bruises from the hail, and then bought as much booze as they could fit in their dent covered cars.

,TalesFromRetail,"I worked at a major department store almost 18 years ago. (2002ish) I was stationed in the juniors department. And a sweet little old lady (about 70) came up to my register with a return. I of course went to start the process. Should be simple.

Now I’d been working there for more than a year at this point, and pretty much knew the items that we had carried during that time.

The lady put 2 bags of returns on the counter.  And proceeded to mention that she didn’t have the receipts any more... That shouldn’t be a problem I tell her, as store policy says she doesn’t need one.  But that without the receipt, she’ll only get back the lowest price it has sold for. She said that was fine.

And as I peek into the bag to begin, I see clothes I’m absolutely sure we don’t sell. But, they still have tags attached.so I suspiciously scan one. Nothing comes up.  I scan something else. Still nothing... I mention to her I’m having trouble scanning the items. And that I’d need to call over my supervisor. (while on the call I mentioned quietly that I’d never seen any of the clothes she was trying to return.)

The sweet lady was so patient. And chit chatted while we waited. My supervisor came over, and looked in the bag. She just stood there staring. She looked up at the old lady. And said “ um ma’am, when did you purchase these items?”

The lady replied that she had found the bags when she was cleaning out her closet. She thinks it might have been from 1982? 

Which explained why I couldn’t scan. The register only had info for last 2 years...

She called down the store manager and they honored the return. They tried to approximate what she should be getting back. She left about 45 minutes later. Quite happy. 

To this day the return policy hasn’t changed. You can return something you bought nearly 20 years ago, with little to no problems. Ridiculous!

I start ringing up this ladies items. Instead of putting them on the belt for me to scan and bag she makes me sort through her cart to scan each and every item and then snapped at me for not bagging them. I was confused that she broight me a cart full of small items but expected me to dig through and bag them instead of just setting them on the belt like you're supposed to do at a store. She was angrily tapping the whole time and was in a huff because I asked her to flip over her giant bag of dog food for me to scan. Maybe she didn't notice that I am visibly 8 months pregnant so I couldn't just start playing with her 40lb item. 

I finish and she's out of my life so I can tend to my line that doubled in the 10 minutes it took me to ring her up when it should of taken 1/5th of the time. At least, that's what I thought. 

20 or so minutes later she rushed back into the store, completely beet red and fuming. I am in the middle of ringing up another customer and she interrupts them so I can help her instead. 

""You charged me wrong."" 

 I tell her politely that ""I would be happy to fix the error for you as soon as I'm done helping the man next to me."" 

I get to her not even 30 seconds later and she shoves the receipt at me. She is raising her voice but not quite yelling.  ""Why didn't any of your sales show up?""

I look at the list and I see the sales clearly there. A couple 10%'s off on our popular items. A bogo here and there. Everything seems fine. I circle these and hand the recipt back to her and ask her
 
""Is there was anything missing that I'm not noticing since the sales showed up.""

She then raised her voice even more and asks me ""How am I supposed to be able to see this? I want a new recipt with ink on it! How am I supposed to go home and show my husband this? He'll want to know how much money I spent!""

I can make out each individual letter and number. The normal black ink was just more of a grey In places since low ink. The total was clearly there along with the total and upc of each item. 

I look up her account to try and reprint the recipt for her but when I rang her up the first time she refused to give me one so her recipt isn't in the system.  I show her my screen. I end up getting my manager who had to go to the back office and scroll through the recipts from my register during the past 30 mins to find hers and print her a new one. He was gone maybe 5 minutes. During this whole time she called both us us liars once or twice.

While he is gone I start ringing up more people and she interrupts again, ""Can't you make him go faster? My dog is BOILING ALIVE in my car!"" (It was roughly 50°F that day).

,TalesFromRetail,"This wasn't a story that happened to me, but I was there to witness it happening. So I work in a boutique shop that sells basically everything. Holiday stuff, home fashion, furniture, food, pet stuff, kitchen, bathroom, candles, toiletries, you name it. This story happened a little over year ago so some dialogue may not be completely accurate. 

I was working register that day and this woman comes up to me with her receipt saying that something came up wrong and was kinda rude about it saying how she came in the other day and it was supposed to come up at a different price. 
At the time, registers couldn't do refunds, only customer service did.

 So I called up someone and they told me they had to do customer service but they'll see what they can do. As we were waiting, my walkie went off and I hear my coworker's voice come out from the other end. She said a line that makes you beyond curious upon hearing it.

""Can I have a manager at register 8?"" 

(Note, I was on register 2 which is closest to the door).

As I hear that, a customer walks passed my register towards the door and looked at me and my customer and he responds with, ""someone call the police! We have an ahole over here!"" and continued to walk out the door. As soon as that customer said that, all of our attention went towards my coworker.

There was an older man beginning to scream at her and from where I was at, it was a bit hard to hear because of his screaming, but I did hear something like ""YOU STOLE MY MONEY! YOU'RE ROBBING ME AND I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS!"" 

This guy was screaming so loud, that everyone who was either within checkout or front of the store radius was paying attention to what was happening with this guy and my coworker. There were several people telling him that he needed to calm down, but he always responded back with ""MIND YOUR OWN F***ING BUISNESS!""

People around my register were starting to say how we needed to call for security or the police. Even the woman who complained about her receipt was saying how this guy was out of control.. I honestly agreed with them, but the problem was, we didn't have any security and we couldn't exactly call the police either.

Eventually, two of my managers came up (both women), one dealing with my customer, and the other dealing with this customer. At this point, I started taking my next customer apologizing to her for the wait and continued on with my business. The guy did walk passed my register to get to customer service but I avoided eye contact.

A little later when we didn't have any customers, I did proceed to ask my coworker if she was ok, and she said she was. She didn't even look phased by what happened. I asked her what even happened since I missed the beginning of this.
She told me that this customer was buying stuff and included roasting sticks that was a dollar. This is a rough translation of the incident. Guy will refer to as Crazy Guy (CG)

Coworker: ok sir here is your change *proceeds to hand him a little over two dollars in change*

CG: I'm not touching that! You overcharged me! *proceeds to show her his receipt to show she accidentally charged him for 2 roasting sticks*

Coworker: oh I did...I'm sorry sir that was my mistake. Mistakes happen.

CG: well I don't make mistakes! 

Coworker: ok sir well you can go to customer service and get your money back

CG: no! I want my $10 back now!

Coworker: sorry sir I can't do that *proceeds to close the register drawer with the change still in hand*
And that's when all hell broke lose for this guy. But the thing is, this crazy guy didn't even spend $10 according to my coworker. He was just really upset over getting overcharged a dollar.

I do have to say that my coworker was a freakin legend because of how well she handled this situation. My guess is that she's older and has dealt with customers like this before. I overheard her say she was glad it happened to her instead of one of the younger employees. I probably would have cried if this was me since I'm terrible with confrontations and people yelling and screaming at me.

My manager did say later on that she came out from the back of the store and heard the screaming, so that should give you an insight of how loud this guy was yelling.

I still work at the boutique place, but out of the almost 2 years, I have worked there, that is the craziest situation I've witnessed so far.

When I started, it s was easy we were told that all procedural changes will come down through the food chain.  As time went on, more and more people got titles at the HQ and they all wanted to show that they re on top of things. 

So we at the store level receive an email informing us of a new policy.   First, we have to place these large stickers on our glass doors, they inform customers that if they've already been drinking, all they have to do is ask any clerk to arrange a ride for them.  Being the difficult SOB that I am by nature, I asked exactly how I'm supposed to 'arrange a ride for a declined customer'?  I was told not to worry about it.

That weekend, in comes one of our regular customers; who has obviously been already enjoying our products, can barely stand up straight.  They ask for me to arrange transportation for them to our County seat, which is a good 45 minutes to an hour away.

I went to the office and informed the manager that we have someone asking for transportation to the County Seat.  The Manager looks at me as if I'm stupid and asks what I expect him to do about it.  I smiled and reminded him I asked 'how' we were supposed to do that when the e-mail first came in, I'd kept the customer waiting for a few minutes, to make sure that my shift would come to an end.  

So, I looked at my watch and the store's clock, to make sure my shift was over.  I then walked to the timesheet and signed myself out and then went to where the Customer was waiting and told them the Manager in the Office was going to take care of their Transportation.  I also tipped the other clerk of my little action.

The next day, the Manager was flipping out when I arrived, I'd screwed home over!  He got even madder when I laughed and asked him in front of the other Managers, Clerks, and Customers, how I was supposed to deal with the problem when I had no idea how to get the customer transportation to the county seat?

It seemed that the Manager called the two local taxi companies that serve our area.  We are a rural part of the county, and he promptly was informed that neither of the Taxi companies would come to our area that late at night.  The Manager had to call the cops to make the guy leave and the guy filed a complaint with the HQ and the Manager caught heel from the HQ for not following the Policy!

,TalesFromRetail,"So I work as the Service Manager at a local car dealer. Basically I am over the entire service department - so most of my day is just dealing with complaints. But I had a new one yesterday - and that’s saying something. 

So a customer comes in for just an oil change. This particular customer had never serviced any vehicles with us before. As soon as he checks out he walks out to his car and pops his hood and “notices” that his engine cover is missing (why would you go out and just happen to pop the hood open if you didn’t already know it was missing?) and proceeds to lose his ever-loving mind. Of course, I get involved. He claims that he just checked his oil yesterday and the cover was there but now it’s not. I walk back to my technician’s work area to check and see if maybe he took it off and just forgot to put it back on, which can happen sometimes. In this case, there would be no reason to remove it, because it’s not required to do an oil change, but I figured I should at least cover all my bases. I check around his work area, his tool box, etc, and there is of course no cover. I asked him if he noticed it, and he tells me that there was no cover on it when he opened the hood. 

So I basically tell Mr. Customer, “I checked my technician’s work area, and spoke with him as well. It was not on the engine when he opened the hood.” He continues to lose his mind and accuse my technician of stealing the cover. I looked him dead in the eye and said, “sir, I’m pretty positive he didn’t take your engine cover to put on his *entirely different make and model of vehicle.*” I told him I wasn’t buying him a new cover. He proceeds to tell me that he’d be OK with a used one (another red flag - if you were convinced that we stole it, why would you be OK with a used one?) and I told him, just to make him happy, that if I come across a used one, if we have a similar vehicle traded in, for example, I’ll see if I can snag one just to make him go away. 

Fast forward to this morning. Walking by the detail department, there is another exact year/make/model vehicle that had been traded in and they were cleaning up for the lot. I popped the hood and, no cover. Thinking there’s no way it’s a coincidence, I go to my parts department and ask them to price me out a new engine cover. I want the part number and price. Parts guy puts the VIN in and goes, “what engine cover? That vehicle never came with one.”
 
So this a-hole knew there was no cover (he probably bought it used, and there wasn’t one there - and he assumed there was supposed to be) and brought it to us for a cheap oil change because he thought he could just freak out and we’d cave and he’d get one for free. So now, I get to call him Monday to let him know that,

1.) He is not getting an engine cover, because they don’t exist for that vehicle, and
2.) We will not EVER service any vehicle for him at any point in the future. He is fired as a customer.

,TalesFromRetail,"This happened just today. I work at a gas station/general store more in the country. I was outside at the pumps, talking for a minute with a friend who happened to be getting gas when a women asks for my help at another pump. She was trying to use a rewards card for her gas, but the pump wasn't taking it. Honestly, the pumps can be complicated sometimes, and even I didn't know how to fix it outside, so I told her we could do it inside, as those cards always worked inside and I could help her out. 

So, we get to the register, and I put in what needs done into the register, she uses her card and it takes, but then she pulls out another fuel rewards card, totally different and not with our store but more of a universal one. Though, I have never seen this one before. She swipes it to try and get even more money off of gas, and it asks her for a driver's ID code. She does not know it. For literally 15 minutes, no joke, she stood there trying to figure out this code. She tried everything, even calling her mother and the card company itself only to get transferred everywhere with no help. All the while, I'm just standing there unable to help as she's getting increasingly frustrated. But here's the best part - she never once blamed me, yelled, or even gave me any attitude the entire time. No matter how annoyed she got with this card not working and saving her a lot of money, she never once disrespected me like nearly every other customer would have. And she was a stranger too, never coming into the store before nor knowing me personally at all. She was just a genuinely kind, decent person. She even told me she knew the card not working wasn't my fault. Eventually, though, she gave up with it and paid with only the one rewards card, saying she'd deal with the other card company later.

I'm telling you, this women was an absolutely dream customer, so respectful through it all. I appreciate it greatly! I actually got a Reece's and gave it to her, saying it was on me, and I thanked her a lot for being so decent and respectful. Despite all of the frustration with the card and cash, she was really happy in the end and left with a big smile on her face, because she was kind and I appreciated it. 

Not all inconveniences have to end poorly. Not all customers are horrible. It just goes to show, if you can respect the retail worker, you are an amazing human being. And I thank you for that.

This just happened, and my wife called to tell me about it. The sheer rudeness of some people bothers me. My wife works at the a large retail store. She is a cashier. Wife will be K

A few minutes ago, K's customer service supervisor told her to go to break. In order to not get any more customers lining up, because at this point she has two, she usually turns off her light, and has a customer put up a ""closed"" sign on the end of the belt. That was her intention today as well. In order to facilitate that, she asked the last guy in line if he'd be willing to put the sign up for her. He said yes, so she tries to hand the sign to the guy, but he didn't reach for it nor did he walk up. This is usually an indication from a customer to toss the sign. So she tosses it to the end of the belt very gently so it doesn't fly off and hit anyone, and it lands with no issues. This is not an uncommon occurrence at all. He grabs the sign, stands it up, and she says, ""Thank you"" as she continues helping the person in front of him.

She finishes with the first customer, and the guy makes his way to the payment area. She starts her cashier small talk and gets him checked out. As he is finishing the transaction, this exchange happens.

Guy: ""That was really rude for you to throw the sign at me. I want to speak to your manager. I am going to get you reprimanded.""

K: ""I'm sorry? I didn't mean for you to think I was throwing it at you.""

Guy: ""that was really rude. It could have hit me. Get me your manager.""

K *(paraphrased a bit because she said she just kept repeating various amalgamations of this)*: ""I'm so sorry. I thought you meant for me to toss it to you because you didn't reach for it or walk around when I asked if you'd put it up. I really didn't try and throw it at you. I tossed it as safely as I could. We toss it like that to customers all the time. I'm really sorry If you thought I was throwing it.

The Supervisor was on her way up as she says this last bit (the cashiers have the ability to call Supervisors using the register) and asks what K wanted. She tells Supervisor what happened and that he asked for a manager. Supervisor then talks to the guy and he tells her some story that K couldn't hear. She hears the supervisor tell him K will get talked to when she gets off the register. He says thank you and walks away with a smile on his face. He then walks by K, and with a smile, leaves her with these fine words.

Guy: ""I hope you get fired""

As of right now, she has not been reprimanded, nor fired. Jokes on him though.

The transaction has to be voided when we do the paperwork the next morning. My co-worker gets the manager. She’s going off on him. I vouch for my co-worker, I saw the whole thing. My manager asks her, “when you swiped your card and the total correct button came up, did you hit yes?”  She confirms that she did. He just asks, “why?”  Lol&lt;/p&gt;

Quick backstory so when I was just out of high-school I worked in a small liquor store in a high risk area.

My rule is simple if you get in before I lock the doors ill serve you but if you take longer then 10 minutes after close i'll ask you to leave with no purchase cause it's after 1 am and I want to go get some sleep. So C1 comes barreling into the store and instead of  walking in like a normal person he decides to try and jump the turnstile at the entrance to stop shoplifters from trying to run out the front door. And low and behold as he runs past the wet floor sign directly in front of the turnstile he slipps and only makes it half way and collides directly with the arm of the turnstile tip to tip. His buddy helps pick him up laughing at him and they start browsing. Cw goes outside and locks the doors and finishes up closing until my till is the only thing left to do.
 
Low and behold there ten minutes are up and they haven't made a single choice yet. I pipe up "" hey you guys the store closed 10 minutes ago I need you to pick what you want now or leave"" well C1 takes offense to me telling him that he has to leave the closed store and replies "" you know I got hurt on your property so I can take however long I'd like and you should be giving me everything I want for at least half off if not free unless you want me to sue you"" him and C2 started laughing and walking around and joking about what they should help themselves to.

Cw looks at them like they are idiots and tells them they can get the hell out of the store right now or she will call the police and have them removed. 
Well once again C1 and C2 don't like being told what to do and walk up to the counter snickering and ask how we would like going to court. I look at them tired and tell them that right now they have 2 choices 1 they buy something and leave now or we call the police cw already has the phone all ready to go and that we don't care if they sue us cause we don't own the store and his injury was self inflicted. he ignored the wet floor sign, and tried to jump the turnstile when he could just walk through. C1"" well can I at least get a discount"" C2 at this point realizes that we are pissed as he grabs the closest 12 pack and says ""okay well get this and leave"".

,TalesFromRetail,"I haven't heard this phrase throughout the 4 years of working in retail but trust me after hearing this phrase for the past 2 weeks now its driven me insane.

Customers come up to me with their returned items without the receipts and claim that they should surely be able to get away with that because the tags are still on the clothes/items.

I'm from the UK so I guess it might work differently, but I have never come across this, possibly seeing this sort of stuff in films and tv shows but thats it. 

IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN YOU MUST HAVE A RECEIPT WITHIN DATE WITH THE CORRECT CARD IF YOU PAID WITH CARD.

The tags don't do anything.

You see in order for me to process the returns, I need to scan a receipt (even if its been photographed) that receipt allows me to go through and select the items that need to be returned (they all have different kimball numbers etc). That way I am able to give the money back to the customers and finish the refund. 

If I scanned a tag it would probably not work or think that its a standard payment transaction. 

2 weeks ago I had to spend my final minutes of my shift (closing time too and also this went over my shift time) trying to explain to a lady that she needs the receipt and having the tags on the items does nothing. It was amazing to see how much denial and delusion she was in. ""But I'm sure you used to return things with tags""

WE NEVER DID. 

If we did then it was probably 10 years ago. It doesn't mean we still carry the same philosophy today. Times have changed and I'm certain that she is a frequent customer of the company I work for her so its unlikely she wouldn't have known this. 

Its incredible with what ideas customers come up with when it comes to returning things.

""Maybe if I just have the tags on the clothes they'll happily give me my money back""

,TalesFromRetail,"So this happened Friday afternoon starting about 2:30 pm and ending around 4:30 which isn't a super long time to have issues but it still wasn't great. 

I work at a hardware store as a cashier and on Friday I was by myself on the lumber end of the store at what are called the pro registers due to being located next to the pro desk and being frequented by contractors aka the pros. 

About 2:30 I noticed that there was some significant slowing down of the register processing card transactions. We've recently gotten ""new"" (in quotes because everything my store gets is refurbished and/or hand me downs from other stores who were lucky enough to get brand new equipment) pin pads which while still buggy were significantly more usable than the old ones which had a bad tendency to only work perfectly for maybe 25% of the transactions. One of the big improvements (other than being fairly certain that no it really is the customer's chip being broken and not a 50/50 toss up of the pin pad just not working to read chips again) was that they're significantly faster at processing transactions. 

Also when searching for items on the Online Cashier Book (system that's supposed to list items from the store and have a function to search things from if they don't have a barcode but has the worst search functionality I have ever seen) aka the OCB, was running even slower than usual and giving me more connection errors than typical. 

Then the lone pro desk worker started having issues with his phone. In the middle of a call with a customer the line started breaking up so he tried to move the call to the other phone at the desk only for the phone to decide to reboot itself the second he lifted the receiver from the cradle. All else failing he ended up calling the guy back on his personal phone and kept dealing with weird issues with the phones for another thirty minutes. 

At three I get sent on my break and notice that the store wifi has gone from slow but mostly functional to completely unusable and now people are having issues with the time clock saying it's not connected to the network when they try to clock in or out. Well this is going steadily downhill. 

Get back from break and continue checking out the sparse customers. Now customers who try to pay with a card are getting declined. First guy ran his card a second time and it went through but the next couple of people to try couldn't get it to work at all so I sent them to self check out in the hopes it was just my register having weird issues. 

Next thing I do is try to call my head cashier to see if they're having issues on his end of the store. Oh would you look at that the phones are now completely down and nobody can contact each other anywhere in the store. And now a customer is trying to call the non-functional phones which rerouted the call to the overhead PA system and it's endlessly ringing. Yay.

So as I'm sending customers down to the other end of the store saying my register isn't working I'm trying to get a hold of anybody to see if they can tell me what's going on so I text my supervisor's personal phone hoping he sees it quickly. 

Again no luck and it takes fifteen plus minutes and several more customers before I finally hear back from somebody over the walkie talkies we use for our lot loaders and they inform me that yeah all phones are down which took down the internet (or the other way around possibly. All I know is one going down took out the other) which then took out our ability to process card transactions. They're now trying to inform an assistant manager (again no in store phones are working so can't call him directly and nobody is sure where he was at first) to see if he could figure out what was going on. 

So then I get the joy of informing customers coming in that our system can't currently take cards which means cash only, we can't currently look up, process, or release any online orders, and we can't get a hold of anybody that isn't within shouting distance. Luckily we're not very busy (at least on my end of the store) but the first customer I get who came in before we started having the issues, seems to take it personal that something went wrong with our system and that I can't take his debit card as payment. 

I apologize but he just goes on a rant about how he needs all of this right now and we should know when our system will be back up (yeah sure, I've totally got clairvoyance) and how is it possible that it went down and blah blah blah. Can't he leave this on hold with us and we call him back when the system comes up. Nope sorry, we only do will calls for items that have been paid for. We don't hold unpaid items because they take up space we don't have. And anyway I highly doubt the will call system is even currently functional at the moment since nothing else is currently working.

By the time this guy is done ranting at me he decides to add more items to his order which is already well over the couple hundred in cash he had on him and then informs me that we're gonna become friends because he's going to stand there in front of me until the system comes back up. 

4:30 hits and it's time for my lunch and another cashier comes down saying that they've had luck running debit cards as credit and to try that, which I suggest to my customer to get him out of my face. He completely ignores my instructions to run it as credit and puts in his PIN but by some miracle the transaction went through. I get a hold of lumber to get the guy the rest of his stuff, listen to him bitch about a couple more things then make my escape to get lunch. 

By about 5 everything got fixed again and we didn't have to continue to listen to customers whine about a technical issue we had no control over but it was a long 2 and half hours of dealing with weird slow downs and then a complete system crash. 

Later heard from another coworker who came in after everything was over that it was possibly a widespread issue since he stopped at another store before he came in and they said they were also having internet problems. Also another cashier said a customer said they lived in a nearby neighborhood where everyone also lost internet so who knows. 

But you gotta love the customers who think we personally made our system crash just to cause them issues.

,TalesFromRetail,"So this happened today last week and now it’s all over I feel like it’s a story some might enjoy. 

I work in a small kiosk in a shopping centre where we sell phone cases and accessories. It’s a slow Monday morning and I’m walking in the centre side doors near my store when I spot a wrist strap and pop socket mount on the floor. I waltz on through the door thinking “ha, how funny would it be if we got robbed”. Low and behold, a security guard is waiting for me. My stomach drops and I start to freak because the owners of the company have a habit of being absolutely horrible to their staff when the smallest problem happens. I closed on Sunday. I thought I must’ve forgotten to lock something. I was sure I was loosing my job today. 

I walk over and the security guard has a chuckle and goes “looks like someone had a bit of a fun here!”, thanks buster. I run around the store about to pull my hair out and start crying. The perpetrator has gotten to our store iPad, store phone, all the coins in the tills and some other miscellaneous items that weren’t worth much. THANKFULLY he didn’t get to the safe so most of the cash was ok. 

First I call my boss, expecting to have my head bitten off. No answer. I call my manager. No answer. I call the other staff member who was supposed to be working today. No answer. After I send them all texts the other staff member calls back. I’m freaking out and she’s going “Are you serious? Your kidding right??” In the middle of the call my boss rings me. I tell her what happened and brace for the “Your gonna have to pay for all the losses”. But too my surprise she told me to calm down and just write a list of everything missing. It was at this point I was like “oh yeah, insurance is a thing”. 

The rest of the day was mostly a blur. The stores around us all found out in no time and looked on their security cameras. We saw the thief in action. This is where I get confused. This guy was either really smart and knew what he wanted, or really dumb and did it because he was on drugs or wanted an adrenaline rush. He started robbing the store at about 5:20pm, an hour and 20 mins after the shops close on a Sunday. He was walking up and down the centre, making little stops in at the store each time. But that’s about where his intelligence dies. 

He opens all the tills and probably gets about $50 in coins from each one. He yoinks the store iPad which is a very old one and probably worth about $70 AUD. The store phone is some cheap Nokia that we only recently got. Probably worth $100 AUD. He gets to the spare pair of keys we keep in the store and this means he has access to everything however, this clearly doesn’t click to him. He could’ve stolen all of our name brand cases that are worth $40+ each but instead he just focused on the tills and their cabinets underneath. He took some ring grip display stands, a medical box and a bin full of iPad straps that come with a case we sell. He took two boxes full of our best selling screen protectors which was annoying and then our note books??? I don’t know what this guy was thinking when he grabbed a book with flowers on it and a note on it saying ‘daily store tasks’. 

Worst part of it all was because the centre was technically still open, people walked past and saw the cheeky bastard stealing but did nothing. If you see something that looks sketchy, please alert security. You’ll save a poor retail working from a panic attack. 

The cops didn’t do anything because there were over 1000 break ins over the weekend in the area (dodgy af area) and our tiny store was bottom of the priority list, which was not surprising. The store itself was not very secure as it’s very much due for renovations. The guy broke through most of our cabinets and barely even used the keys. In the end I think this guy got maybe $300 worth of items and a bunch of retail workings laughing at him.


TL;DR
A guy broke into my store at 5:30 in the afternoon on a Sunday and stole about $300 worth of items while patrons walked past and gave me, a mere retail worker, a panic attack for the entire duration of my 8 hour shift.",t2_5hixmui8,False,,0,False,My store got broken into,[],r/TalesFromRetail,False,7,long,0,,False,t3_jlzn33,False,dark,0.98,,public,174,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Long,False,174,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1604251948.0,text,7,,,text,self.TalesFromRetail,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this happened today last week and now it’s all over I feel like it’s a story some might enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in a small kiosk in a shopping centre where we sell phone cases and accessories. It’s a slow Monday morning and I’m walking in the centre side doors near my store when I spot a wrist strap and pop socket mount on the floor. I waltz on through the door thinking “ha, how funny would it be if we got robbed”. Low and behold, a security guard is waiting for me. My stomach drops and I start to freak because the owners of the company have a habit of being absolutely horrible to their staff when the smallest problem happens. I closed on Sunday. I thought I must’ve forgotten to lock something. I was sure I was loosing my job today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk over and the security guard has a chuckle and goes “looks like someone had a bit of a fun here!”, thanks buster. I run around the store about to pull my hair out and start crying. The perpetrator has gotten to our store iPad, store phone, all the coins in the tills and some other miscellaneous items that weren’t worth much. THANKFULLY he didn’t get to the safe so most of the cash was ok. &lt;/p&gt;

I worked at a small privately owned gas station in 2006. This was just the start of the owner wanting people to prepay their gas.

,TalesFromRetail,"A couple years ago when I worked at a national hardware store chain I had an encounter with a mean older man. Let me specify that when I say I worked *at* the store, I didn't work *for* the store. This is important later. I worked for the company that supplied the flowers and shrubs and trees. But I was always at that store when I worked.

For some background, I'm pursuing a degree in Forestry, minoring in horticulture. I've taken three quarters of the classes needed for a bachelor's in horticulture. (For personal reasons I'm leaving it at that and coming back later for it) and I worked for two semesters in a plant biology greenhouse/conservatory on campus. I also keep well over a dozen plants on my own.

All I mean by saying that is that I know how to water plants. I also know that when you water plants that are for sale (needing to look nice) and bunched together tightly and frequently shaded, you want to avoid drenching the foliage so the plants can breathe and take up water to avoid root rot and the foliage dying. Presentable flowers get sold, rotting flowers do not.

I was watering them by using a long handheld sprayer, shooting the water into my cupped hand and directing the water underneath the foliage with my hand. Honestly I thought it was a clever move, since no one else watered them that way and a third of our stock seemed to be lost to rot. 

 In comes the 60-year-old man who tells me I'm doing it wrong. His wife is nearby.

 I ignore him.

He tells me I'm doing it wrong again.

I've had a long day by this point, it's hot and in the middle of the summer in the Midwest, and I'm irritated.  So I keep ignoring him.

Then he tells me that I'm wrong again and that I'm stupid for doing it the way I'm doing it. And that he's owned a commercial greenhouse for 30 years so he knows what he's talking about. 

After he told me I'm stupid for doing it this way, I turned to him and said sternly and loudly, 'shut the f*** up and leave me alone.'

He stood there for a second, a brief moment of shock. And then he yelled, 'Where is your manager?! I'm going to report you!'

Remember how I said that I don't work for the store? 

I looked at him and said, 'he oversees seven different stores in this part of the state, good luck finding him.' 

It should also be noted that my boss was a woman, not a man, but I opted not to say that.

At this point he was getting really flustered, his wife came over looking sheepish and put her hands around his arm and gently started pulling him away.

This just happened today. 
So, this is my first job as a cashier specifically, and there have been some weird customers at my register over the past few months. I live in a small-ish beach city that's pretty tight-knit, so its not often we get crazies, but they happen.

On to the story, though. A man comes up to the belt, and he's carrying three beers and a plastic container of soup. I ring up the beers but then notice that he's still holding the soup. 

I tell him that he needs to put the container on the belt so I can scan it. He ignores what I said and moves over to the pin pad. I tell him again,  a bit firmer, that I need to scan the soup.

He looks down at me and says, with the conviction of an old god, ""You are *mistaken*.""

He then proceeded to leave the store without the beer but *taking the soup*. I follow him out, calling across the parking lot that he needs to come back and pay, but he doesn't turn around or even flinch, and just walks out of sight.

After I clocked out hours later, I called my girlfriend to tell her about what had happened. She found it hilarious, and it really made the ridiculousness of the situation clear.

I joked that he must've been some kind of fae or something, and I'd failed some kind of test. And then I got home to realize I'd forgotten it was payday, and hadn't picked up my check

""Hi there, welcome to \[Phone Company\] how can I--""

I'm not often left speechless, but I was shocked to silence. I stood up slowly, stretching to my not-inconsiderable 6'3"" height, looked him in the eye, pointed a finger at him and said, ""back of the line.""

He blinked, confused. ""Excuse me?""

""Get away from my counter, and get to the back of the line,"" I said. ""You're not ready to buy a phone.""

The guy looked at the line of six people behind him and back at me. ""No, I'm here to buy--""

I said, ""No. You aren't. You see those people behind you? I know all of them. I've been handling their accounts for years. That's why they're lined up for me when they could've gotten through quicker with one of my coworkers. They understand I work hard to keep their bills down and take care of them. And you walk up, swear at me and insult me from the get go? You aren't ready to buy. You definitely aren't ready to buy from me. Get in the back of the line. Now.""

""Who do you think--""

""Next!"" I shouted, stepping away from my register. The sweet Puerto Rican lady behind him looked nervous, but I told her to meet me further down the counter, and I took her bill and got to work on her payment. 

The guy was staring in disbelief and goes, ""I'm going to take my business elsewhere!"" My favorite threat.

,TalesFromRetail,"For about a year in high school I worked at an international retail store in the US. Employees of this company would get a 10% discount on merchandise. Naturally I would use this anytime that I bought things for myself. 

However, as a cashier you see all different sorts of people in all different sorts of situations. I was seeing single mothers with several children who are buying baby food, wipes, diapers, clothing, etc. People who are in situations where they obviously cannot afford what they're buying but they have to buy it anyways. 

I had the bright idea of using my discount to help them out, on the register or I was logged into, using my ID card. Do you see where this is going? 

It felt really good to see the looks of appreciation on these people's faces, so I kept doing it.

I ended up doing it half a dozen times over the course of several weeks before management called me to the back room to have a 'chat'. 

Apparently, whenever you use your discount on a register that you're signed into it creates a red flag in the system. The manager who was supposed to be tracking that was on vacation for a week at the time and didn't catch it until I had already given away $150 worth of discounts.

The two managers that were talking to me in the room brought me in there with the intent to fire me, they told me this afterwards, when they asked me why I did it I explained that I was only doing it for the people who clearly really needed the help, and what I was giving discounts on.

A customer placed a $500 deposit using their credit card to start the process on an order. The customer canceled the order a few days later and was well within the cooling down period. The order was canceled, and the money was refunded to the card. This all happened within the same week back in December of 2019.

The sales person in question is one of our most succesful sales people and last year almost made $200,000 in total compesation. Truth be told, until recently no one had paid any attention to this particular transcation. 

The sales manager at the start of October sent out a marketing email to all his past customers sharing some news in an attempt generate some business. The customer from December of 2019 said he didn't want to do business with him, requested to be removed from the mailing list (first time he's requested this to our knowledge, which we did comply with) and accused the sales person of stealing his $500.

The sales person checked the order, ensured the money was refunded as it should have been, even going out of his way to check with accounting who did confirm the refund was issued with no serious delay or issue. 

The sales person advised the customer of this, to which the customer accused the sales person of stealing his $500. The sales person provided the customer with his manager's contact details and told the customer if he feels that strongly that he stole from him he should report him. 

The customer filed a complaint with us, we invesigated the compliant, we determined that indeed everything has been done by the book and that the credit card used was actually a card in the customers name. Basically no funny business took place. We however did invite the customer to provide bank statements if he feels like we didn't refund the money, and if we can't see the refund we will send him a $500 check. Generally when we do this the customer goes back, sees that we did indeed refund the money but they didn't notice it.

The customer rejected our response and demanded he be compesated and threatened legal action. Over $500...it was esclated to our regional VP who reviewed the details and came to the same conclusion. To which the VP wrote this email

""Dear Customer

It has come to my attention that you have accused Person X of stealing $500 from you. You used your own credit card to place the $500 deposit and canceled within the grace period which means you received a full refund. We have checked our accounting and everything appears to suggest that this is exactly what happened. We have invited you to provide evidence if you disagree with this statement and even went so far as to say if you can prove the money was never returned to you we would mail you a check in the amount of $500. You have failed to provide any evidence supporting your claims. 

Also, Mr. Sales Person is one of the most successful sales professionals in our organization and has over a 15-year track record of proven success. Mr. Sales Person has one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings in our organization by a substantial margin. In addition to it is impossible for our salespeople to steal customer deposits, our system simply does not allow for that. The fact that you have accused him of stealing your deposit with no evidence to back up your claim is disturbing. 

In response to this, you have decided to threaten us with a lawsuit. I have spoken to our lawyers and they have advised me if you wish to pursue legal action you should have your attorney contact them, the contact details are below. Furthermore I have made the decision to blacklist you from ever being a customer of ours again.

Please note any responses to this email will be forwarded to our attorney.

I wish you all the best""

&amp;#x200B;

In this festive time of candy and horror delights, I thought back on my first and last time working at a Halloween store as a side job from my main job in the same shopping plaza. I say the ""last time"" because of the lousy manager who was 22 but acted 16, and the constant snatch-and-run thievery that happened almost daily. Great experience and I had fun getting into character, being an active cosplayer, but I'll never do it again. No no no, god no.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, the job had its perks and I enjoyed assisting people look for costumes and often worked the fitting room. I loved helping kids with their costumes if something didn't fit right or something was backwards before they checked out the mirror and got feedback from their parents. I didn't expect to love that part of the job so much since I was never very good with kids, but I remembered how much I loved the holiday at that age. They were so cute and my heart nearly exploded helping this little girl tie a ninja costume because it was her first time trick-or-treating.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I finished my 9AM to 2PM shift at my retail job and jogged across the parking lot to the Halloween store, changed into the company shirt and got to work. I was asked to work the fitting station and I helped this woman with her grandkids. While the kids changed, I chatted with the grandma, she asked me how I liked working there. I was honest and said it was fun and how I liked helping the kids the most.

&amp;#x200B;

My stomach had been growling since before I started my shift (I only had a bagel all day) and the lady heard it. She said she hoped I had a break soon so I could eat. I told her since I worked part-time at my main job and immediately came here part-time, I wouldn't be able to eat until my shift ended around 6PM, but I did have a Payday bar I was nibbling on and off.

&amp;#x200B;

Her grandkids loved their costumes  (I think the boy was Link from one of the Zelda games and the girl was a zombie cheerleader) and the grandma said she'd get the costumes. She asked where the makeup and face paint was and I showed her.

&amp;#x200B;

It was slow in the store so I offered to put the costumes back in the packages before they checked them out. While I did that, the grandma handed me a $20 bill. I just looked at her when she said, ""Get yourself some food, baby. You're a very sweet girl.""

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I politely refused and told her we didn't do tips at this store. She winked and told me, ""It's not a tip. I'm just paying for your lunch.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a giving person growing up. Gave my snacks to friends, gave money if I had a little to spare, gave food to my coworkers when I cooked/baked something at home. For me to be given something out of the goodness of someone else's heart... That almost never happened to me, so I was really taken aback. I wanted to cry and thanked the grandma for her kindness.

&amp;#x200B;

My main paycheck just barely covered my bills, leaving me with just enough for Uber fare to get to work and home, and little extra for food. But my last paycheck was lighter than usual (worked 15 hours instead of my usual 18 to 22) so I didn't have much. My faith in humanity was strengthened that day.

&amp;#x200B;

Little acts of kindness, people. NEVER stop showing them. You never know how someone's day is going. Your little act of kindness might be the best part of someone's otherwise crappy day.

I was cashiering and this older woman comes up to me. She says she would like to make a suggestion for me, that I start asking if the customer would like their receipt back after doing a return.

 She goes on about how she needed her receipt because she had other stuff she could have returned. She was pretty angry about it so my first response was , ""me personally?"" She says angrily ""yes you! You threw away my receipt after a return and didnt even ask if I wanted it!!"" Now, i have always asked the customer if they want to keep their old receipt after doing a return. If they say they dont want it, I simply throw it away. I guess defending myself became my downfall. I say to her, ""I always ask customers if they want to keep their receipt"" she says to me, actually yelling this time, ""no you did not you threw it away!!!""  I said ""I dont appreciate the way you're talking to me"". She is still yelling at me and being extremely upset over this and taking it very personally with me. I have never had a customer actually yell at me before. I proceed to call my manager, and over the phone I explain that I have an aggressive customer who is yelling at me. The lady says "" I am not yelling at you! Wow. You are a sad little girl and I feel sorry for you!"" That really got to me and I started tearing up. 

I don't even recall ever seeing this lady before. Again, she was very personal with me and even looked at my name tag and said my name. She goes ""she was at that register and I remember the blonde hair and everything!!"" To my manager when he eventually showed up. And she completely denied ever yelling at me or being upset. She said ""I never raised my voice at her"". She did, she was extremely nasty.  My manager takes care of her and rings her up since she was buying stuff. I had to take a breather and go to the back and I just cried in the break room. My coworkers saw. I was just embarrassed and didnt expect to be crying so much.

,TalesFromRetail,"Okay so this happened to me yesterday, but according to coworkers has been happening since Friday. Like my last post, this took place at the gas station job and it pertains a certain customer determined to cash a check. 

It was a normal Monday night, which by that I meant 90% of our sales was alcohol since the store is in a neighborhood full of alcoholics. We often get checks written over the amount for cash back so I usually don’t think too much about it so long as they have an ID on hand. Well, this one lady came in and with a small handful of things to buy, delivered me a prewritten check well over the total for cash back. It raised numerous red flags right away. 

Here’s the thing, our store is the one of the few in my city that that takes out of town checks. But we don’t take checks from out of state. So if you have a check from Florida, you won’t be able to use it here. Her check was from Minnesota, though her ID was of this state.

Second was that it wasn’t a bank check. We will accept credit union checks only if the union is one from our town but we don’t take checks from out of town unions. 

I usually distrust prewritten checks. It’s my own personal thing, I prefer to see the check written when people pay with one.

It was over the total amount, on its own not bad, but the check was roughly 115 dollars over. 40 is our max for cash back. 

It was written in red ink. And unless something changed, banks can’t accept checks in red because something about their systems. 

Save for prewritten, all of those are grounds to refuse because store rules. But when I explained it to her, good Lord you’d though I hit her and then threw her dog off a bridge. She was offended and pissed and kept going on and on over how we always take her checks, how I’m so unreasonable and being an incredibly rude employee for refusing. I explained to her the rules again and specified that Our Owners specifically told us not to accept checks that did any of those things. 

Oh no no no, she wanted me to call the manager. Claimed to be best friends with the manager. It was past nine at night our manager would have been asleep because she does the 5am opening. I told her that no, I’m not going to wake my manager up for this, if you claim to be such good friends then go ahead and call her. She didn’t, of course.

At that point she had gotten some others attention in the store and one of our regulars in the casino had come out and was standing off to the side to see if he needed to intervene (he’s a very big guy, but very nice, always steps in when our drunk customers get out of hand). I just told her she needs to leave.

Instead of leaving with her dignity, she threw the check at me and said she’d be back for her money, that she’ll call the owner and that I can kiss this job goodbye, and I won’t have any luck getting employed anywhere else with my attitude. Of course, she never came back my shift, I informed my boss and left a note for the manager in the morning. Found she’s been coming in at different times these past few days trying to find an employee who’d cash the check.

Like my last post, this took place at the gas station job and it pertains a certain customer determined to cash a check. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a normal Monday night, which by that I meant 90% of our sales was alcohol since the store is in a neighborhood full of alcoholics. We often get checks written over the amount for cash back so I usually don’t think too much about it so long as they have an ID on hand. Well, this one lady came in and with a small handful of things to buy, delivered me a prewritten check well over the total for cash back. It raised numerous red flags right away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing, our store is the one of the few in my city that that takes out of town checks. But we don’t take checks from out of state. So if you have a check from Florida, you won’t be able to use it here. Her check was from Minnesota, though her ID was of this state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second was that it wasn’t a bank check. We will accept credit union checks only if the union is one from our town but we don’t take checks from out of town unions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually distrust prewritten checks. It’s my own personal thing, I prefer to see the check written when people pay with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was over the total amount, on its own not bad, but the check was roughly 115 dollars over. 40 is our max for cash back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was written in red ink. And unless something changed, banks can’t accept checks in red because something about their systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save for prewritten, all of those are grounds to refuse because store rules. But when I explained it to her, good Lord you’d though I hit her and then threw her dog off a bridge. She was offended and pissed and kept going on and on over how we always take her checks, how I’m so unreasonable and being an incredibly rude employee for refusing. I explained to her the rules again and specified that Our Owners specifically told us not to accept checks that did any of those things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no no no, she wanted me to call the manager. Claimed to be best friends with the manager. It was past nine at night our manager would have been asleep because she does the 5am opening. I told her that no, I’m not going to wake my manager up for this, if you claim to be such good friends then go ahead and call her. She didn’t, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point she had gotten some others attention in the store and one of our regulars in the casino had come out and was standing off to the side to see if he needed to intervene (he’s a very big guy, but very nice, always steps in when our drunk customers get out of hand).

We did not have in-store security but we had camera guys who would watch the store and call us if they saw anything or they would deter theft by speaking over the intercom. One day a couple comes in and was shopping for quite awhile. It was getting that time of night were we would start cleaning and making preparations to close.

&amp;#x200B;

The phone starts to ring and low and behold it is the security guy (SG).

&amp;#x200B;

SG: Hey this guy just brought a few hats into the dressing room. I don't know why he had to try them on in there and not just use the mirrors. When he gets out of there could you go in just make there nothing suspicious is left behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree and let my coworker know what's up. I head near that air and start sweeping out the empty dressing rooms. About three minutes later he walks out and I walk in and do I quick sweep and check. Everything looked fine. I walked out and was immediately confronted by Hat Guy (HG).

&amp;#x200B;

HG: do you want to pat me down to?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: What?

&amp;#x200B;

HG: Do yo want to pat me down to?! WHAT is it because of my tattoos, I am so offended. How would you like it if people were checking behind you like you are stealing?

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I'm sorry sir I didn't mean to offend you.

&amp;#x200B;

HG: Well you did! 

&amp;#x200B;

He goes on like this for a bit and I am just so fluttered by this guy. I didn't know what to say or do to fix this situation.

Me: Sir I am really sorry, our security guy just wanted to be sure, it is nothing personal. I am really sorry for offending you.

&amp;#x200B;

I then walk away, heading back up to the registers. I hear him muttering as he goes up to the Girl (G) he came in with. I hear him tell her what happened and I am immediately hear her start raising her voice getting mad. That's when they started for the registers and I knew it wasn't over.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hello again.

&amp;#x200B;

G: I can't believe you guys. Accusing my boyfriend of stealing, just because of his tattoos! (she says this as she is throwing her things onto the counter.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I am really sorry about that.

&amp;#x200B;

G: I shouldn't even be buying this \*\*stuff\*\*, if I didn't need it I would have left it in the aisle for you to put back. This is ridicules. We are never coming here again.

&amp;#x200B;

I just decided silence was best, and just tried and not make the situation worse. They are mad and just going to be mad, nothing I can do about it. As I hand them the bags and receipt, HG walks up from behind the Girl.

&amp;#x200B;

HG: You know what, I want to talk to the security guy bring him out here right NOW! I want to give him a piece of my mind!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Sir I can't do that

&amp;#x200B;

HG: I want him to come up here and--- and I want to punch that motherf\*cker is his stupid face.

I am shocked by this outburst, I look at my coworker and she is just as shocked. I push the bags closer to him.

Me: Have a Great night SIR.

The stores in our area were having a problem with people coming in right at open and making a small purchase (usually under $5) and trying to pay with a $50 or $100 bill. Often we would get two in a row before our first hour of being open. Our district manager put in a policy that in order for a customer to pay with a $50, the purchase has to be over $20, and for a $100 it has to be over $40. This is the background for the phone call I took the other day.

This was the call:

&gt;me: Thank you for calling [craft store] this is Ninedolphin, how can I help you? 

&gt;customer: hi, yes, I was in earlier today and had a purchase, it was only about $10 or $11, and I tried to pay with a fifty, but your cashier told me she wasn't allowed to take a fifty for anything under $30, is this correct? 

&gt;M: (knowing that telling her it was actually $20 wasnt going to help) Yes ma'am this is a policy that was put in place by our district manager in order to ensure that we have appropriate levels of change to provide our customers. 

&gt;C: Well, but there wasnt a sign at the door or at the registers. So how is it an actual policy? 

&gt;M: We cannot have any signage that is not a corporate directive. This is a district policy, so we are not authorized to have signage regarding it. (This was where I went wrong. I assumed I was dealing with someone reasonable.) 

&gt;C: (going from 0 to 60, and actually starting to yell) Well then it shouldn't be a policy! I can use whatever money I have! It made me feel so small when she told me I couldn't use my money! 

&gt;M: (getting irritated) Ma'am, I'm sorry that that happened, but this is an official policy from above. I can certainly suggest to my District Manager that we put up signs but until I get that order there is nothing I can do. 

&gt;C: There should really be signs up telling customers they can't use their money! When am I supposed to find out that my money wasnt good enough for you!?! 

&gt;M: (having lost all patience, in my best 'teacher voice') When my cashier informs you of this.

This,  however,  is my first post,  &amp; my first time on Reddit.  Ever.  Brand-spanking-new here,  so please be gentle.  I know enough by now to say that I'm posting from a tablet,  &amp; don't know WTF I'm doing. I do have a lot of great/funny stories from my days in the grocery store game,  &amp; I thought,  ""Why not?"" Let's proceed...

At 16 (1994) I got a job as a bagger in a popular grocery chain that shall remain unnamed. It's irrelevant, anyway.  I quickly became everyone's favorite bagger around the store,  mostly because I actually did my job properly,  instead of assing off like most of my juvenile co-workers.  In even had regulars,  who would deliberately get in line at whichever lane I was stationed at, despite the wait,  because they knew I'd bag their stuff properly. Honestly,  it was a lot of fun,  most of the time.  But this wouldn't be much of a story if I were reminiscing about the good times,  would it?

One evening,  here comes Cake Lady (CL) with a gigantic sheet cake that barely fit into the cart,  &amp; a 50-lb bag of dog food.  That's it, nothing else.  She was an older lady,  probably in her 60s, tiny,  &amp; seemingly frail.  But she managed to get her cake,  special order from the deli/ bakery, custom-decorated, &amp; her dog food onto the belt with minimal difficulty. The cashier scanned her 2 items, CL paid,   &amp; I was just starting to get them back into her cart when an ear-splitting bellow shattered the relative peace of the entire front end...

Cast:  Cake Lady (CL), Cashier (C), general manager (GM), &amp; me (ME)

CL:  NOOO!

(I stopped,  frozen in place, my hands reaching for the cake to place it gently back into her cart, unsure of how to proceed.)

C: Ma'am?

CL:  I don't want HIM (gesturing toward me in a somehow condescending way) even TOUCHING my cake!  The last time I was here, he completely ruined it! 

(Keep in mind that although this was a big grocery store,  it was a small town. I knew the regulars,  some even by name. I'd never even seen this woman before,  &amp; I certainly had never ruined anyone's cake. I'm overtly conscientious,  &amp; if ANYTHING like that had EVER happened,  I would've reported it  myself immediately.  As I said,  I actually took my job seriously.)

C: Him?  Are you sure? (She knew me,  &amp; my reputation in the store.)

CL: YYYEEESSS! (She actually said it like that,  hissing with exaggeration like a snake from a Floridian cartoon.) He destroyed the last cake I bought,  &amp; i won't have him touching THIS one!

(She refused any other assistance,  &amp; insisted on placing her items back into her cart personally. Mind you,  she'd already paid.)

So... in goes the cake, flat on the bottom of the cart (not the lower rack,  just the basket part), &amp; she puts the gigantic bag of dog food (!!!) standing straight up at the front end of the cart. 

ME: Uuhhh... Ma'am? (Still trying to help,  &amp; avert what I see as an oncoming catastrophe) 

CL: Shut the f@%&amp; up!  I know what the f@%&amp; I'm doing! 

She took 2 steps &amp;, of course,  the bag of dog food came crashing down on her precious cake,  completely destroying it.

CL: FFFU$@&amp;÷=CK!!!

&amp; without another word,  she shoved her cart into the wall,  hard enough to chip off a chunk of cinderblock (that was one STRONG old lady!), &amp; walked right outta the store,  without even taking the dog food,  let alone the smashed cake, never to be heard from again... Or so I thought. 

About a week later,  I got called into the general manager's (GM) office.  This was odd,  because normally any complaints about employees would be handled by supervisors or department managers. This was THE BIG BOSS,  so I was naturally scared stiff. I was thinking that I was either about to get fired,  or promoted.  It was THAT serious. I don't recall the conversation verbatim,  but it went something like...

GM: We've had a complaint so serious that I'm handling it myself.  This is the complaint... (He proceeded to lay out CL's complaint,  which I immediately recognize from the aforementioned incident.  Only,  it's full of lies.  She'd told him that I had deliberately &amp; maliciously destroyed her cake,  not only once,  but TWICE. She'd threatened to sue,  wanted me fired,  etc. &amp;, unbeknownst to me,  she'd been back in the store that week,  &amp; had pointed me out to him.)

ME: (utterly flabbergasted, but sure as Hell not caving)  Uummm, sir?  You can ask anyone, either my co-workers or the customers,  &amp; they'll tell you I would NEVER do anything like that.  Matter of fact, PLEASE,  ask the cashier who checked out that Lady.  Better yet,  check the security footage."" 

(1994, as I said,  but this was a brand new store,  with all the bells &amp; whistles they could throw at it.)

GM: Alright.  We'll do that.  Get back to work. (He was actually an awesome boss,  who supported his employees. It'll be a factor,  if I post about this job again.)

&amp; with that,  I was dismissed,  back to my menial duties.

Footage reviewed,  ""customer"" banned, permanently,  &amp; I went on about my job,  not much later to be promoted to cashier &amp; then FES (Front End Supervisor), with many more stories to relate.

Today, I had the pleasure of attempting to fix a non-functioning register. The screen wouldn’t turn on. I am not exceptionally tech-savvy, but I can generally figure out which cables go where and why and perform basic troubleshooting. When my best efforts yielded no results, I called tech support. Enter Juan. Juan, after walking me through the same troubleshooting steps that I had just performed, asked me to email him a picture of this register. It’s different than every other register in the store. Turns out, Juan has never seen a register like this before in his life. 

Juan: “Can you switch out the screen with a functional screen from another register? That way we can tell if it’s the screen or the cable.”

I very quickly realized this wasn’t going to work. Not only are the other screens very different, the connecting cables are as well. There is no way to connect the existing tower to a different screen. I don’t have the right cables. I explained this to Juan. 

Juan: “Can you put the broken screen on a different register, then?”

Me: “No, as I explained, I don’t have the correct cables.”

Juan: “Then can you at least move the cables and a functioning screen onto the tower you are working on?”

Me: “No. the other end of the cables aren’t the correct ones either.”

Juan: “Ma’am, I’m trying to help you. If you aren’t willing to try then I’m not sure what else I can do for you.”

Me: “Listen. The cables to this monitor are different from all the other ones I have. They are USB on one end. The other registers don’t even have USB ports. The power cords are completely different shapes. THERE IS NOT A HOLE THAT WILL FIT THE POWER CABLE. It’s not that I’m not willing to try. I CAN’T.”

We offered a no taxes discount on applicable items to those with a Native Status card, and to apply this they needed to present the card at the beginning of the order, we would check it for validity, and the order could begin. 

Well, one fated day, a couple comes through, maybe mid to late thirties, and they have a medium sized order, which I process with no problems, no indication of what is to come until I tell them their total. The man says they have a status card, and I tell him that unfortunately they would have needed to declare it at the beginning of the order for me to apply the discount. The woman starts insisting that we can do it for her, that we've done it before etc. So I call the CSM (Customer Service Manager, equivalent of a front end supervisor) over, explain the situation, and ask if there's anything we can do. I still want to help the customer at this point, even if she's been a little rude. The CSM explains that short of erasing the order and scanning it in again, this time with the discount in place, there's nothing to be done.

 The woman chooses that, and while the CSM is erasing the order, I say in an apologetic tone, ""Sorry, this is why we need you to show us the card at the beginning of the order,"" by which I meant that it would take even longer for them to be able to leave. Admittedly, this was not the best thing I could have said at the time, but she snapped at me (not an exact quote, but the gist of what she actually said) ""I knew that you could do it, so don't be stupid."" I said something else, I think something to the effect of ""Please don't call me that, ma'am,"" to which she replied even more venomously, and although I don't remember the first part of her sentence, I could never forget the second part: ""Maybe it's time for you to shut up.""

I had never been told to shut up by a customer before. I'd had my fair share of rude customers before, to be sure, and even been sworn at and had my intelligence insulted, but for some reason being told to shut up like that was the tipping point, because I did shut up, and after they were gone, the man whose order was next asked if I was alright, and all I could do was ask another CSM if I could go to the bathroom, where I promptly burst into tears. 

When I came out, obviously still quite upset but not crying anymore, the front end manager told me to take my lunch early.
When I came back is when this story takes a turn. Apparently the manager and yet another CSM had been standing at the front doors, watching for this couple to drive by, and when they saw them, the front end manager actually ran after their car, and when he managed to stop them, went off on them about how they treated me and proceeded to ban them from the store. I hadn't particularly gotten along with my manager before then (he's harmless, just very outgoing and slightly odd personality) but this incident instilled me with a newfound respect for him, and a stiffer upper lip around customers.

,TalesFromRetail,"My store has a weekly $5 off a certain amount sale each Saturday. No problems there. It's the digital coupon for this sale that bothers me. Do you know why? Because it doesn't get priority over other coupons during checkout. What happened tonight really put that in perspective.

There's an older man (possibly 60s to 70s) who I only see on Saturday for the sale. Normally, he's really calm, but tonight he acted different after I told him his total. The register didn't take his $5 off coupon. This time, he had an unused $3 off coupon that usually takes priority during checkout. He told me the small bowl of dog food should be free because of a vendor coupon, and it was. After checking and adding up his savings, we saw it wasn't $5 off. He asked if I could just knock off the $2 since the register chose the wrong coupon, and I told him I'm not in control of which coupon the register uses, and he looks very disappointed.

Old man: ""So, there's nothing you can do about this giving me the wrong deal? How long have you been working here, that they haven't shown you how to do that? That makes no sense. Just go in and take the $5 off instead. That, or change the price since I'm a regular.""
Me: I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about this. If there's a coupon that's less than our current sale, then it takes priority. This has nothing to do with my decision. I can ring everything back up and try again, but if the $3 off is all it'll do, my hands are tied.""

He looks pissed. I've never seen him frown, let alone look or sound angry. He tells me to take an item off to see if it'll work (like that would change anything 🙄), but I do it anyway to prove a point. $3 off coupon pops up again, and now he's finally calming down, only to see it was still there.

Old man: ""Now I know you're doing it. There's no way it would use the same coupon TWICE. I don't want $3 off. I. WANT. FIVE. DOLLARS. OFF! Fix it or I'm calling your manager up here to do it for you!""
Me: ""Sir, I've done nothing but scan your items, hit total, and tell you what to pay. There's no decision on my part. There's also no change I can make on this transaction. I have nothing else to tell you.""

He looked so mad.

Old man: ""THEN TAKE ALL OF IT OFF SO I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I'M TIRED OF ALL THESE STORES TELLING ME HOW MY MONEY WORKS! THANKS FOR NOTHING!""
Me: ""Okay. I'll take everything off. Have a good night.""

He grabs his buggy by the handle, swings it off sideways hitting another woman's buggy. She wasn't paying attention, so she was basically gut punched by the handle of her cart out of nowhere. I told him it'd be best if he didn't come back here because he'll be asked to leave on sight. He'll be banned by Monday. All of this over $2 extra? Shameful.

Btw, I was the manager tonight. He would've had to ask me to fix a problem for myself. He probably assumed I was the cashier because mine was in the bathroom.

TL;DR: An old man throws a temper tantrum because dog food was $2 more than expected, then unintentionally hurts a woman out of anger. My register works fine.

EDIT: I've seen people say I should've just changed the price for him. ""I made a mistake for losing a regular customer because I didn't care, and it was only $2"". These are digital coupons, so it's ENTIRELY out of my control. I don't even know if there coupons will work until I hit total. I do care about my customers. I tried changing his price a couple of times, but the system wouldn't let me. Yes, I acted poorly for telling him not to return, but it was the heat of the moment. I'll thoroughly apologize to him if he returns. I left out me trying to change the prices because I thought that was obvious. I don't see this as bait and switch because he had an already existing coupon on his account. I called my manager this morning, and she said the only thing I did wrong was tell him not to come back.

No problems there. It&amp;#39;s the digital coupon for this sale that bothers me. Do you know why? Because it doesn&amp;#39;t get priority over other coupons during checkout. What happened tonight really put that in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an older man (possibly 60s to 70s) who I only see on Saturday for the sale. Normally, he&amp;#39;s really calm, but tonight he acted different after I told him his total. The register didn&amp;#39;t take his $5 off coupon. This time, he had an unused $3 off coupon that usually takes priority during checkout. He told me the small bowl of dog food should be free because of a vendor coupon, and it was. After checking and adding up his savings, we saw it wasn&amp;#39;t $5 off. He asked if I could just knock off the $2 since the register chose the wrong coupon, and I told him I&amp;#39;m not in control of which coupon the register uses, and he looks very disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old man: &amp;quot;So, there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do about this giving me the wrong deal? How long have you been working here, that they haven&amp;#39;t shown you how to do that? That makes no sense. Just go in and take the $5 off instead. That, or change the price since I&amp;#39;m a regular.&amp;quot;
Me: I&amp;#39;m sorry, but I can&amp;#39;t do anything about this. If there&amp;#39;s a coupon that&amp;#39;s less than our current sale, then it takes priority. This has nothing to do with my decision. I can ring everything back up and try again, but if the $3 off is all it&amp;#39;ll do, my hands are tied.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looks pissed. I&amp;#39;ve never seen him frown, let alone look or sound angry. He tells me to take an item off to see if it&amp;#39;ll work (like that would change anything 🙄), but I do it anyway to prove a point. $3 off coupon pops up again, and now he&amp;#39;s finally calming down, only to see it was still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old man: &amp;quot;Now I know you&amp;#39;re doing it. There&amp;#39;s no way it would use the same coupon TWICE. I don&amp;#39;t want $3 off. I. WANT. FIVE. DOLLARS. OFF! Fix it or I&amp;#39;m calling your manager up here to do it for you!&amp;quot;
Me: &amp;quot;Sir, I&amp;#39;ve done nothing but scan your items, hit total, and tell you what to pay. There&amp;#39;s no decision on my part. There&amp;#39;s also no change I can make on this transaction. I have nothing else to tell you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked so mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old man: &amp;quot;THEN TAKE ALL OF IT OFF SO I CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I&amp;#39;M TIRED OF ALL THESE STORES TELLING ME HOW MY MONEY WORKS! THANKS FOR NOTHING!&amp;quot;
Me: &amp;quot;Okay. I&amp;#39;ll take everything off. Have a good night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grabs his buggy by the handle, swings it off sideways hitting another woman&amp;#39;s buggy. She wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention, so she was basically gut punched by the handle of her cart out of nowhere. I told him it&amp;#39;d be best if he didn&amp;#39;t come back here because he&amp;#39;ll be asked to leave on sight. He&amp;#39;ll be banned by Monday. All of this over $2 extra? Shameful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, I was the manager tonight. He would&amp;#39;ve had to ask me to fix a problem for myself. He probably assumed I was the cashier because mine was in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: An old man throws a temper tantrum because dog food was $2 more than expected, then unintentionally hurts a woman out of anger. My register works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, we had a piano that had been donated that had obviously been tipped over as the sounding board had a giant crack in it.

,TalesFromRetail,"Okay so this was when I first started at my job little over 7 years ago. I was overall still learning how things worked in retail, let alone just having a job in general. So one afternoon I was asked to go fetch carts because they were getting low upfront. So I go out to the Cart Corral to collect the carts and I look down and I see a Flash Drive on the ground. Now absolute context, I was still young, didn't really know better, I just found a Flash Drive that likely someone is looking for. So I thought FREE FLASH DRIVE and pocketed it. Story Over!

Okay but not really. There was a part of me that had this wrong thought. But honestly I'm way too nice of a person, while I did still pocketed the Flash Drive, I had an idea that maybe I could of find out who the Flash Drive may belong to, most of the co-workers I was with were... well old and didn't understand tech enough. I had a feeling if I turned it in it would of just sat in some box for years if not straight up tossed away. So I thought I take the chance of pocketing it to see if there was any info in the Flash Drive that I could gather when I got home.

The day ends, I get home, and the first thing I do is I throw in the Flash Drive, and what I find was literally someone's life and career. Folders of Blueprints of houses, construction plans, and other complexities that I still don't understand but know enough that this could of been a hell of a thorn if forever lost. And when I scrolled all the way down in one of the files, I found a name and a number.

I gave the person a call, luckily he picks up and I say ""Hello, is this (Person's name)?""

The Gentleman responds ""Yes, who am I speaking to?""

""Hey my name is (Name) and while I was working today I found a Flash Drive in the parking lot while collecting carts. I plugged it in at home and found a name and number listed in the drive. I would be happy enough to give it back to you.""

The man was honestly really happy that someone found it and was willing to return it. I then told him the next day I work as well as time I clock in that day, I figured that would be the perfect place to give the Flash Drive back. Sure enough not even 10 minutes after clocking in, I see a gentlemen talking to my at the time GM. Something told me that this was the person. I walk up and ask ""Are you (Gentleman)?"" And sure enough it was. I give him back his Flash Drive, he thanks me multiple times, and even rewarded me $30.

When the gentleman left, my boss tells me ""OP, you did a good thing."" I may of not turned in the lost item like I should, but I still went out of my way to not only find the owner but return the item to owner. And honestly I'm glad I was able to get a name and number from that drive. Moment I saw blueprints, I knew this was going to be someone's life.

I was overall still learning how things worked in retail, let alone just having a job in general. So one afternoon I was asked to go fetch carts because they were getting low upfront. So I go out to the Cart Corral to collect the carts and I look down and I see a Flash Drive on the ground. Now absolute context, I was still young, didn&amp;#39;t really know better, I just found a Flash Drive that likely someone is looking for. So I thought FREE FLASH DRIVE and pocketed it. Story Over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay but not really. There was a part of me that had this wrong thought. But honestly I&amp;#39;m way too nice of a person, while I did still pocketed the Flash Drive, I had an idea that maybe I could of find out who the Flash Drive may belong to, most of the co-workers I was with were... well old and didn&amp;#39;t understand tech enough. I had a feeling if I turned it in it would of just sat in some box for years if not straight up tossed away. So I thought I take the chance of pocketing it to see if there was any info in the Flash Drive that I could gather when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day ends, I get home, and the first thing I do is I throw in the Flash Drive, and what I find was literally someone&amp;#39;s life and career. Folders of Blueprints of houses, construction plans, and other complexities that I still don&amp;#39;t understand but know enough that this could of been a hell of a thorn if forever lost. And when I scrolled all the way down in one of the files, I found a name and a number.&lt;/p&gt;

They further enforce this by not stocking up on more seasonal items as it gets closer to that holiday.

I was hired around Halloween time, so, of course, Halloween items were at the peak of demand. Contrary to retail’s practices, nobody buys Halloween stuff in August!

Our store learned this the hard way.

By the end of October, our store was already packed with Christmas items while the Halloween section remained scarce. There wasn’t much left besides some home decor, cheap costumes, and a few bags of unpopular candy. My colleagues and I faced more than a few customers getting mad or cussing us out for no longer stocking anymore Halloween items.

I'm Irish. Ireland is going into full lockdown at midnight tonight so I wanted to stock up on some essentials before it kicked in. One of those essentials was a couple of sides worth of very fresh salmon (emergency sashimi supplies). 

So, I got to the fishmonger, nice asian lad, he didn't have any sides cut but he had a couple of whole salmon (yay!!) so he started to fillet and debone them. For some wierd reason, Ireland, an island entirely surrounded by seafood, isn't that into seafood, so this is a bigish order. He begins to do his thing, I wait.

We look up. It is a small shop, with social distancing, one customer inside at a time. The doorway is fully occupied by an Irish-Karen. She has the hair, the stance, the 'ahem', the works.

He looks back down at the salmon, decides that it needs to be trimmed some more.

Better check for bones too. Again. 

*AHEM!!*

Perfect. Time to start on the second one. Nice careful trim. Check the angles, trim again.

,TalesFromRetail,"So I used to work in a grocery store in my town, and I have collected quite a few stories from there and my time abroad and I have finally convened on this location to share one of my plethora of memories.  Depending on how this post is received I may pump more experiences out here, so I hope you guys enjoy!

Now I think many of us enjoy a good meme here and there, a funny joke etc.  I for one enjoy humor and employ it as a method to both ease my tension and (hopefully) entertain the customer of which I was scanning out at the checkout line.  It was a week before Thanksgiving and I'm sure many retail workers know firsthand how chaotic that time can be, and so much jokes were much more prevalent.  

While I was checking out, my supervisor hands me a frozen turkey, stating that it needs to go back to the meat department and that she'd take over for me while I go personally deliver it.  This is routine and I thought nothing of it, so I accepted and headed towards the meat department.  I arrive at the frozen turkey selection and place a turkey down within the freezer.  It is then when a friendly old lady walked up to me and asked ""excused me OP, do these turkeys get any bigger?""  Remembering a certain meme I had found, I chuckle and say ""no ma'am, they're dead.""  She laughs wholeheartedly along with me, and I tell her I'll check with the meat department since I'm only a cashier and they'd have a larger turkey for her.  She thanks me and I meet with the meat manager in their cooler and tell him about the customer.  I then retire back to my post on the checkout line.  

Now, after this I hadn't thought anything of this little interaction.  I would have forgotten about it altogether if it wasn't for my manager calling me to her office to talk to me.  Apparently my joke had gotten a complaint from a customer.  The customer had told my manager that my joke about dead turkeys was insensitive towards the animal and that I wouldn't be making those jokes about people so why should I with turkeys (I totally would by the way.)  We both agree that it was kind of stupid and that I shouldn't have done it, but she did find the joke funny so I think I got off easy with that one.  

Now a few hours have gone by, and I am on self checkout when a lady approaches me.  At first she didn't look out of the ordinary from her leather purse, fur coat and overall karen-esque appearance, and I met with her with my usual cheerfulness.  ""Hello, my name is OP how may I help you"" I asked.  The lady reveals herself as the filer of the complaint, stating that I should've been fired for what I said.  I accidentally let out a little chuckle and say ""so it was you"".  Everything had made sense to me at that point.  This lady had overheard my joke with the older lady and had taken offense to it.  She begins to berate me saying that if someone were to joke about my death I wouldn't take kindly to it.  I politely retort ""ma'am, I wouldn't mind because I'd be dead"" and she starts fuming.  I know I was stirring a hornets nest, but man was I having fun.  

However, even Nostradamus couldn't predict what this lady was about to do.  With a smug confidence, she got in my face and said ""would you kill me if I was a turkey?""  She then starts doing chicken motions and making chicken noises at me, and I couldn't help myself.  I start laughing, and oh man it was not a gentle laugh either.  My sides began to hurt but I couldn't help myself, this Karen just looked SO stupid!  From the other self-checkout kiosks I could see customers stifling giggles and pointing towards the chicken Karen (I will call her Choco-Karen because I play way too much FF and chocobos are like chickens).  Choco-Karen, now finished with her poultry outburst, repeated her question.  ""If I was a turkey, would you kill me?""  

While I was enjoying this tirade, all good things must come to an end so I begrudgingly told her ""ma'am I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, you're causing a disturbance for the other customers"".  What I should have expected was her following wrath, but alas I did not (how could a woman who had an outburst like that remain calm after being told to leave, me from the past wasn't that smart).  She demanded that I answered her question and I responded ""no, I wouldn't kill you but I would call security if you do that again.""  We did not actually have store security, but it was a little tactic I would use to intimidate people being rowdy.  Fortunately, Choco-Karen seemed to be deterred, and as she walked towards the door she began to yell the standard spiel like ""I won't ever shop here again until you get fired"" and even called me an animal hater (I have two dogs and generally spend more time with people's pets than the person themselves so that's a lie).  I won't forget her last words though.  As she walked out the door, she yelled ""Your soul will burn unless you repent you animal-killer!""  

Now as my tale comes to a close, I can't help but explain the aftermath.  A few employees who had heard the incident had told a few more employees, and through word of mouth within the hour everyone in the store had known of my encounter with Choco-Karen.  I would never see Choco-Karen again, so she was true to her word but I would earn a title of ""Turkey Bastard"" which I wore proudly until I finally left that position a couple years later.  Now, as I sit here several years later recalling the events of this story (which I am sure I may have forgotten a few details), I can't help but ask the question.

From the other self-checkout kiosks I could see customers stifling giggles and pointing towards the chicken Karen (I will call her Choco-Karen because I play way too much FF and chocobos are like chickens).  Choco-Karen, now finished with her poultry outburst, repeated her question.  &amp;quot;If I was a turkey, would you kill me?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was enjoying this tirade, all good things must come to an end so I begrudgingly told her &amp;quot;ma&amp;#39;am I&amp;#39;m gonna have to ask you to leave, you&amp;#39;re causing a disturbance for the other customers&amp;quot;.  What I should have expected was her following wrath, but alas I did not (how could a woman who had an outburst like that remain calm after being told to leave, me from the past wasn&amp;#39;t that smart).  She demanded that I answered her question and I responded &amp;quot;no, I wouldn&amp;#39;t kill you but I would call security if you do that again.&amp;quot;  We did not actually have store security, but it was a little tactic I would use to intimidate people being rowdy.  Fortunately, Choco-Karen seemed to be deterred, and as she walked towards the door she began to yell the standard spiel like &amp;quot;I won&amp;#39;t ever shop here again until you get fired&amp;quot; and even called me an animal hater (I have two dogs and generally spend more time with people&amp;#39;s pets than the person themselves so that&amp;#39;s a lie).  I won&amp;#39;t forget her last words though.  As she walked out the door, she yelled &amp;quot;Your soul will burn unless you repent you animal-killer!&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as my tale comes to a close, I can&amp;#39;t help but explain the aftermath.  A few employees who had heard the incident had told a few more employees, and through word of mouth within the hour everyone in the store had known of my encounter with Choco-Karen.  I would never see Choco-Karen again, so she was true to her word but I would earn a title of &amp;quot;Turkey Bastard&amp;quot; which I wore proudly until I finally left that position a couple years later.  Now, as I sit here several years later recalling the events of this story (which I am sure I may have forgotten a few details), I can&amp;#39;t help but ask the question.  Why was someone like Choco-Karen in the meat department anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I work at a specialty retail store in a small
city. 

Back in July, we had a customer who seemed shifty, so we paid special attention to him. He ended up trying to shoplift a pair of shorts by wearing them under his pants, after using the changing room to try them on (we had taken note of every item he had taken in to try on). When confronted, he claimed that he had just mistaken the shorts for his underwear, because he hadn’t worn any underwear that day (🤢!). 

My boss flipped out on him, because even the guy’s excuse was gross, and he was banned from the store (after handing over the shorts he had attempted to steal). He was wearing underwear, BTW, I saw the waistband when he lifted his shirt to show us that he wasn’t trying to shoplift.

Today we had a customer who tried on shoes, selected an expensive pair to buy, and then was asking for a specific type of denim, which sparked a memory in my boss. He grabbed his phone and started looking at photos. It wasn’t long before my boss came to me and asked, “Is this the same guy?” As someone with prosopagnosia (face blindness), it’s very hard for me to be sure, even when looking directly at someone, but a coworker was sure it was the same person. 

My boss confronted the man and told him that he had been banned from the store. He told him that he had to leave immediately. They guy started to argue, saying that he had just moved here and needed the shoes he had chosen (they were waiting at the till for him) and that he had never been in before. 

He kept arguing that this was the first time he had ever been in, but eventually agreed to leave, still insisting on getting the shoes first (“Fine, I’ll go, just let me pay for the shoes!”). While he argued, my boss took out his phone and opened the picture he had taken of this guy in July, after he had tried to shoplift the shorts. 

He held up his phone and showed the guy the picture. 

The shoplifter’s response? “That’s not me.”

My boss’s response? “Yes it is.”

They shoplifter’s response, “...how did you get this?” 

How did my boss get it? He took out his phone, in full view of the customer, and took a picture of him in our store on the day he was caught trying to shoplift. This wasn’t done secretly, the guy saw it happen. It wasn’t alien spy technology, we didn’t photoshop him into a picture of our store for funsies, it was a clear picture of him in our store, proving that he was a liar.

We (everyone on staff) loudly kept insisting that he leave (with me holding the door open) until he left. He kept trying to argue (with increasing desperation) that he would leave after buying the shoes he had chosen (my boss told us later that when this guy was in in July he had said that he couldn’t find these shoes anywhere else, and had also put up a fight about leaving without them when he had been caught trying to shoplift, apparently this guy always choses his beloved shoes first and then starts his antics). 

We quickly realized after he left that he had parked in a staff spot next to our building, next to an employee’s car. We were worried that he’d damage the car out of anger, so an employee ran out to video his leaving (and also get his license plate, couldn’t hurt). They employee came back in laughing, because the attempted shoplifter, in his haste to escape, had dropped a pawn slip with his full name and address. We had a lot of laughs with the results of googling his name. The guy is a train wreck.

I think, “How did you get this?” might also become a catchphrase at our store, because we kept repeating it, and then bursting into laughter at how ridiculous it was! How indeed?!?!

I just hope that when he tries to
come in again we recognize him faster.

,TalesFromRetail,"This happened the first month I worked in Retail.  I was working the closing shift with the Assistant Manager, a nice older guy.  The other clerk that was supposed to be there called out sick, so its Friday night, the store is packed and we are busy.  

It's Friday Night and the store is busy, the other clerk called out sick and so its just me, the new guy and the Assistant Manager, a nice older guy and we're coping.

In comes, this strange little guy, looking shady and wanders around the store looking up and down the shelves.  and then finally comes to the register to ask about a specific brand of whiskey.  The minute he got near my register I could smell the booze on him.  He is slurring his speech and can barely get out the name of what he wants.  First, we don't carry it and second, we can not legally sell it to a person we suspect has been drinking. (State law)

I explain we do not carry that product, and even if we did I cannot sell him anything, since it seems he has already been 'enjoying' our products.

Well, he isn't having this!  He starts by pleading, then goes to demanding.  Now I can be fired and held legally responsible if I make an exception.  I'm over 6 feet and over 200 pounds, the guy is 5 foot nothing and about 110 pounds.

I looked over at the Assistant Manager who knew me well enough to know that when the guy threatened to reach over the counter, and I smiled at him, gritted my teeth, and told him that if he reached over my counter, his new nickname would be 'lefty'.

The Assistant Manager excused himself from his customer and came over and told the guy to leave or else, he was not getting served!

He looked down and stomped out of the door. We thought that was the end of it.  But no.

A group of College People came in from the local University, and the strange man slipped in with the group.  I noticed him and signalled the manager.  Who shook his head.  Customer flow slowed down and the man started picking up bottles from the shelves and sitting them on the tile floor in a line along the seam of the floor.  

The Assistant Manager told the guy to stop and leave.  His response, 'No'.  I'm getting annoyed and told the Assistant Manager I'd be willing to toss him out the door, and through it, if he did not want to hold it open.  He had a better idea!  

The Assistant Manager calmly went into the office and called the local Police.  We do not call the Police often and so when we do call they arrive quickly.  Step through the door and I point to the guy, who by now had lined a dozen bottles on the floor.

The two Officers that came in where huge, they walked over to the guy and he looked from the floor up these guys like they are buildings, wide-eyed.  The Officers asked us if we wanted him to put the bottles back and we said no, we'd handle it.

She just so happened to receive a video of this incident and an email was sent out to all of our other stores in the district. On mobile and still at work so I apologize for the format and any errors.

In all our stores cosmetic sections, it's an open layout. So customers can walk along numerous paths and even right behind the register.

The video started off with a man walking up and looking around inside. He is looking for just a couple of seconds before the head starts swiveling, looking around constantly for an employee. Somehow he pulls a full sized crowbar out from his pants, and he was walking normally up to the counter before like that thing was not there. It took little over a minute but barely grazing two for him to pry the front of the glass case open (without shattering the glass) and took the entire filled shelf of woman's gucci and vera wang boxes then stuffed them into a bag he brought in with him. Still looking around, he went over to a side panel with nyx pretending to be interested in the products there before speed walking out the doors a few feet away.

&lt;p&gt;So the culprit (I won&amp;#39;t say who in case they somehow find this story) was at check out with about 60 dollars in groceries (not the actual number, but it&amp;#39;s around this amount). They paid for it, the cashier gave change and they went on their way. When they got into the parking lot, *Gasp* they learned that the cashier didn&amp;#39;t give them exact change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did they do? They went back into the store, had a meltdown in front of God and Country, and proceeded to throw all of their groceries away; all the while, giving an &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll take my business elsewhere&amp;#39; declaration. All 60+ dollars worth of groceries went into the trash. Now, why did they do this? Because the cashier was off by 15 cents.&lt;/p&gt;

,TalesFromRetail,"I actually forgot about this story. But, after posting a couple stories on here, I remembered. Sorry if the info seems vague, did happen quite some time ago. Might not be 100% accurate, more like 65%. But, it did happen.

Anyway, I was working at a thrift store when I got a phone call at my register. This wasn't uncommon considering they pretty much had cashiers do everything from calls to stocking products. Also, wasn't uncommon for people to call to ask if we had any certain items or where we were located. But, this was probably the most memorable phone call I ever got.

So, the phone rings and I answer it with ""Hello, this is (store name here) my name is RayWolf16 how may I help you?""

Then a voice with a slight accent asks me, ""Yeah I would like to know if you have a fifth grade geometry book.""

I tell her politely, ""I don't know if we have a book that specific, but you can come in and see for yourself.""

Then she flips, ""No, i need you to check for me.""

Now, a couple details you need to know. While I normally wouldn't have any issue looking for an item for a customer, there were two things preventing me from doing so. One) I'm at the register that has the counter that has the jewelry and more expensive items that we can't leave for any reason. And two) an item that specific is pretty hard to find. I explain these things to the customer and says something along the lines of:

""You work in customer service and you have to look for this geometry book for me! I need this geometry book!""

I won't lie, I was livid when she said this. I wanted to yell "" No that is not my job! How about you get off your lazy a** and come find it yourself!"" But, I didn't. Mama didn't raise no b**ch. So I simply said,

""Okay ma'am, I'll get one of my co-workers to check for you.""

With that, I put the call on hold and asked a co-worker to check the book section for me. Alittle later, as I'm ringing up a customer, the phone rings. Thinking nothing of it, I answer.

""Hello, this is (store name here) my name is RayWolf16 how may I help you?""

""Did you find my geometry book?""

I'm in shock. I look at the phone and see that she's still on hold on the other line. Meaning this crazy b**ch called on a second phone just to find out if we had this d**n book.

""My co-worker is looking for it now.""

She chews me out before I hear my co-worker on the line.

""Ma'am, it looks like we don't have it."" She says.

""What do you mean you don't have it?!""

,TalesFromRetail,"So this happened a couple months back, but I figured I’d share with you guys. So I work in a place that has tire center, and I tend to be up in the sales area helping people get the right tires for their car. We usually have promotions that give you either 110 or 150 off a set of 4 tires. The way the discount gets credited is that you get 10 dollars off of each tire install (so 40 total since it’s one install per tire) and then the rest gets taken off the subtotal.

A lady came in that had ordered tires a couple days prior, claiming that we didn’t give her the full 150 off. Now, this happens very frequently since it’s not obvious that you’re not getting the full 150 off, as it only says -110 under the tire price. I explain to her how the discount works, and clarify that she did get the full discount. She then claims that the promotion is false advertising, since it’s not explained that way anywhere.

I proceed to tell her that she is indeed still getting 150 off, and that while it’s a little odd in how it’s credited, we’re not giving her less than that. Then she demands that we give her the other 40 off, and I again explain that she already has the other 40 off her price. This back and forth continues on for a couple minutes, and I eventually tell her that I’ll get the supervisor to come help her out, since this was well above my pay grade.

Apparently, she ended up going to management, claiming again that it’s false advertising and that she wants the extra 40 off. Obviously she got it, since the customer is always right, and everything went smoothly after that. Just goes to show that if you whine and complain enough as a customer, you’ll get what you want.

I was working the returns desk, which I was still fairly new at, and a customer rolls up with a cart that had two cardboard boxes full of half eaten fried chicken. I don't think I've ever seen that much fried chicken before.

Me: ""Hello, how can I help you?""

Customer: ""I would like to return this fried chicken.""

Me: ""What's wrong with it?""

Customer: ""I ordered this for a family reunion this past weekend. I took it home to my family and when we got to eating it, it was all burnt and nasty. We weren't satisfied, and I'd like my money back.""

*I'd like to note that she's still wearing her family reunion shirt.

She's quoting our fresh food policy, which is 100% money back guarantee. So, I decide to follow through with the return, although in my head I'm thinking why anyone would buy fried chicken from us, ever. Of course it was going to be bad, our deli food is known for being nasty. Anyway, she hands me her receipt and it says she bought 2 orders of 75pcs of chicken, totalling out to about $100. I do the return, give her her money back, and I come around to grab the cart of chicken.

It doesn't end there.

Later, I'm taking returns/claims back to their respective sections; bakery to bakery, frozen to frozen, etc. I roll the chicken cart over to deli, and the two workers greet me, confused. (I don't remember who said what so I'll refer to them both as ""deli"").

Deli: ""What's this?"" They ask.

Me: ""Claims. A lady came and returned these. Said they were burnt and nasty.

Deli: ""And you took it back?""

Me: *shrugs* ""Yeah, it's policy. 100% money back guarantee.""

At this point they're now visibly angry. I have a mini freak out and start to doubt myself. Is that the policy? Did I do it wrong? I was still new at returns so it's possible...

Me: ""Was I wrong?""

They tell me no and sigh. They ask what the customer looked like and I described her to them. They get more angry.

Deli: ""She came in last weekend to pick up that big order of hers. Took us all day to make it. She comes in, and doesn't have enough money! Told us she didn't know it would be that much. She told us about her family reunion and how much it meant to her. She started crying. She only had about $80 on her so we (the deli and bakery workers) decided to chip in and help her pay for the rest.""

One of the weirder experiences I had at my cell phone job was a couple who had come in asking to change their phone number. I said of course I could help, and informed them of the fee. They weren't thrilled by the fee (I don't blame them) and asked if it could be waved due to the fact that this was a necessary change to avoid a repeating issue with a caller.

Being polite, I asked what kind of issue it was. Ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend? No, that would be easy. An annoying coworker? Nope. A jealous guy from the wife's past? Nothing so normal.

Apparently, they were getting calls from a little old lady. They would pick up, she would ask to speak to Peter, and then when they informed her that there was no one by that name there, she'd accuse them of having the wrong number, as if they called her, then demand to speak to Peter, and eventually hang up on them, then call back. This would happen four or five times in a row, every other day or more.

It took a couple of repeats of that explanation to wrap my head around it. ""But....she's calling you....how do you have the wrong number??""

Seeing that I required a more tangible experience with this crazy, God intervened and the phone rang.

""That's her..."" the wife said, handing me the phone. ""Here. Give it a try.""

Me, answering the phone: Thank you for calling \[Cellular Store\] this is Walter, (fake name) how can I help you?

Old Woman: Yes, I'd like to speak to Peter.

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry this is a cell phone store. We don't have a Peter here.

Old Woman: \*audible frustrated sigh\* No! You have the wrong number!

Me: Ma'am, you called me. If you check what number you dialed--

Old Woman: You have the wrong number! Why are you speaking to me??

Me: Okay, Ma'am. You have the wrong number. Have a nice day.

Old Woman: No, YOU have the wrong number! \*click\*

She called back two more times. I didn't answer. I looked a the couple and said, ""well, we can't argue with facts. You have the wrong number. Let's fix that.""

I felt bad for the old woman. I'm sure there was some cognitive decline behind that, but she was pretty fiery nonetheless.

Needless to say, I refunded them the change fee!

Edited to edit stuff for editing.

Edit 2: Several folks have asked/mentioned/suggested just blocking the number. I did, in fact, offer to show them how to do that. They were concerned it'd keep happening with others connected to ""Peter"" and since it was a relatively new number for them, they weren't heavily invested in keeping it, so they just wanted to disassociate from it completely.

This would happen four or five times in a row, every other day or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a couple of repeats of that explanation to wrap my head around it. &amp;quot;But....she&amp;#39;s calling you....how do you have the wrong number??&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing that I required a more tangible experience with this crazy, God intervened and the phone rang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s her...&amp;quot; the wife said, handing me the phone. &amp;quot;Here. Give it a try.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, answering the phone: Thank you for calling [Cellular Store] this is Walter, (fake name) how can I help you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Woman: Yes, I&amp;#39;d like to speak to Peter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ma&amp;#39;am, I&amp;#39;m sorry this is a cell phone store. We don&amp;#39;t have a Peter here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Woman: *audible frustrated sigh* No! You have the wrong number!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Ma&amp;#39;am, you called me. If you check what number you dialed--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Woman: You have the wrong number! Why are you speaking to me??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, Ma&amp;#39;am. You have the wrong number. Have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old Woman: No, YOU have the wrong number! *click*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She called back two more times. I didn&amp;#39;t answer. I looked a the couple and said, &amp;quot;well, we can&amp;#39;t argue with facts. You have the wrong number. Let&amp;#39;s fix that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt bad for the old woman. I&amp;#39;m sure there was some cognitive decline behind that, but she was pretty fiery nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I refunded them the change fee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edited to edit stuff for editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: Several folks have asked/mentioned/suggested just blocking the number. I did, in fact, offer to show them how to do that. They were concerned it&amp;#39;d keep happening with others connected to &amp;quot;Peter&amp;quot; and since it was a relatively new number for them, they weren&amp;#39;t heavily invested in keeping it, so they just wanted to disassociate from it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
